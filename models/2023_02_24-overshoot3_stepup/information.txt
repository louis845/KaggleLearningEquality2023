stepup model (model_bert_fix_stepup)

training data:
final layer: no overshoot
intermediate layer: [no overshoot, overshoot3], ratio: [1/2, 1/2]
embedding vectors generated by BERT L6 H128

training data ratio:
intermediate layer:final layer = 3998:2

model hyperparameters:
units_size = 512
weight_decay = 0.01

intermediate layer:
layers = 4
extra layer = one 128 units dense with sigmoid activation

final layer:
layers = 4
extra layer = one 128 units dense with sigmoid activation
