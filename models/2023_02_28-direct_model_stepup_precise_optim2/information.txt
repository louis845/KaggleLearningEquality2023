stepup model (model_bert_fix_stepup)

training data:
final layer: no overshoot
intermediate layer: [overshoot2], ratio: [1]
embedding vectors generated by BERT L6 H128

training data ratio:
intermediate layer:final layer = 7:1

model hyperparameters:
units_size = 512
weight_decay = 0.0005

intermediate layer:
layers = 4
extra layer = one 512 units dense with sigmoid activation

final layer:
layers = 4
extra layer = one 128 units dense with sigmoid activation

noise:
uniformly 0.5 in intermediate layers
0.015 Gaussian noise in input layer

learning rate:
cosine decay with 0.0005, decay steps=20000, alpha=0.005
