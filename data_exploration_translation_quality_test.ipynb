(Credit: modification of work by Jason Bache/Flickr Creative Commons) \"Eeny, Meeny, Miney, Moe\"—Making Choices The 2008–2009 Great Recession touched families around the globe. In too many countries, workers found themselves out of a job. In developed countries, unemployment compensation provided a safety net, but families still saw a marked decrease in disposable income and had to make tough spending decisions. Of course, non-essential, discretionary spending was the first to go. Even so, there was one particular category that saw a universal increase in spending world-wide during that time—an 18% uptick in the United States, specifically. You might guess that consumers began eating more meals at home, increasing grocery store spending; however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Expenditure Survey, which tracks U.S. food spending over time, showed “real total food spending by U.S. households declined five percent between 2006 and 2009.” So, it was not groceries.

      "There are three major checkpoints for cell cycle control (Figure 1). The first regulates the transition from G1 to S phase. Recall that G1 can be a very long phase, even (in the case of G0) as long as the lifespan of the cell. However, once the cell reaches S phase, it is committed to going through S, G2, and M phases to reproduce. This is because once S phase has begun, there is more than the normal diploid complement of DNA inside the cell. Over time this would confuse the cell (e.g., by overexpression of duplicated genes) as it tried to use the DNA to direct RNA and protein synthesis, and it could become sick and die. The second major checkpoint regulates entry into mitosis. Once mitosis begins, most of the metabolic activity of the cell is shut down, and the cell concentrates its resources on dividing the nuclear and cellular material equally to support the life of both resulting daughter cells. If the cell needs more time to make final repairs on the DNA or even to bulk up a little, this checkpoint can hold the cell in G2 a little longer for those things to happen. Finally,\n",

Charles (1970) states that this cannot be true, since in general the excess head losses will approach the excess head losses matching the ELM.

In the Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice example, we noted that two of the actors were male and two female. The scores of the cases (Bob, Carol, Ted, Alice) on the variable \"sex\" are a nominal dichotomy. It is also pretty common to be able to divide actors in a way; that is, we can record an attribute as a nominal polyotomy (for example, if we knew the religious affiliation of each actor, we might record it as \"Christian,\" \"Muslim,\" \"Jewish,\" \"Zoroastrian,\" or whatever). It is often the case that the structure of a network depends on the attributes of the actors embedded in it. If we are looking at the network of \"spouse\" ties among Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alice, one would note that ties exist for male-female pairs, but not (in our example) for female-female or male-male pairs.

      "Skills to Develop Describe the lysogenic life cycle of temperate phages (including spontaneous induction). Define the following: temperate phage lysogen prophage Bacteriophages capable of a lysogenic life cycle are termed temperate When a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterium, it can either replicate by means of the lytic life cycle and cause lysis of the host bacterium, or, it can incorporate its DNA into the bacterium's DNA and become a noninfectious prophage (see Fig. 1) ( web resource: u2fig18.html). ) In the latter case, the cycle begins by the bacteriophage adsorbing to the host bacterium or lysogen and injecting its genome as in the lytic life cycle (see Fig. 2 ( web resource: u2fig18a ) and Fig. 3 However, the bacteriophage does not shut down the host cell. Instead, the bacteriophage DNA inserts or integrates into the host bacterium's DNA (see Fig. 4) At this stage the virus is called a prophage. Expression of the bacteriophage genes controlling bacteriophage replication is blocked by a repressor protein, and the phage DNA replicates as a part of the bacterium's DNA so that every daughter bacterium now contains the prophage (see Fig. 5) | Flash animation showing adsorption of a temperate bacteriophage.

      "Perhaps the first practical issue we face is determining the effective impedance of an RLC series loop. For starters, resistors in series simply add. Reactances also add but we must be careful of the sign. Inductive reactance and capacitive reactance will partially cancel each other. Thus, the impedance in rectangular form is the sum of the resistive components for the real portion, plus the sum of the reactances for the imaginary (\\(j\\)) portion. We will often find it convenient to express this value in polar form. Example What is the impedance of the network shown in Figure at a frequency of 15 kHz?

      "Introduction Statistical events generate two types of outcomes: continuous or discrete. Continuous outcomes can take an infinite number of values; for instance, a person's height can take any real number, so there are infinite possibilities. Typical events generating continuous outcomes may follow a normal, exponential, or geometric distribution. Discrete outcomes can only on take prescribed values; for instance, a dice roll can only generate an integer between 1 to 6. Discrete outcomes are typically distributed either binomially or multinomially. It is with multinomial distribution that this article is concerned. Multinomial Distributions: Mathematical Representation Multinomial distributions specifically deal with events that have multiple discrete outcomes. The Binomial distribution is a specific subset of multinomial distributions in which there are only two possible outcomes to an event. Multinomial distributions are not limited to events only having discrete outcomes. It is possible to categorize outcomes with continuous distributions to different degrees (high, medium, low). For instance, the water level - a continuous entity - in a storage tank can be made discrete by categorizing them into either \"desirable\" or \"not desirable.\" Multinomial distributions, therefore, have expansive applications in process control.

Big animals like elephants, lions, and whales tend to produce minimal number of offspring but increase the child care to ensure survival. This is called K-strategy, this is opposite to r-strategy usually smaller creatures which employs big numbers of offspring, and most of them will not survive (Figure Figure K-strategic elephant and r-strategic (like codfish) elephant. The second does not exist. Why? Analogously, bigger plants would need to do the same as K-strategic animals: make few daughter plants but defend and supply them with all needs until they mature. However, big secondary thickening spore plants were not capable of family planning; they still made billions of spores and then left them to fend for themselves. Naturally, only few from these billions would survive to become fertilized. Spore reproduction is cheap and efficient but as birth control is not available, results are unpredictable. Even worse, these spore tree forests were not at all stable: in accidentally good conditions, many spores would survive and make sporophytes which start to grow simultaneously and then suppress each other and even die from\n",

Fueron creados por Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky y Braden Kowitz junto al equipo de diseño de Google y de GV (antes Google Ventures). Luego de perfeccionar el proceso y llevarlo a cabo en cientos de problemas, decidieron escribir el libro Sprint donde cuentan paso a paso cómo llevar a cabo un Design Sprint. El nombre viene de la cultura Agile donde se trabaja en Sprints, para ellos un sprint es un período corto de tiempo donde se llega a un entregable. En este caso hablamos de un \"Design Sprint\", que es un Sprint de Diseño.

Английският рог се изработва от африканското дърво кокоболо. Моят е направен от известен майстор в Ню Йорк, като в неговото ателие работят само трима души.

      "Magnetic properties of materials are often utilized in advance technological devices such as Maglev trains, scanning electron microscopy, electron beam physical vapor deposition, and internal and external computer hard drives. There are five types of magnetism: diamagnetism, paramagnetism, and Each type of magnetism differs from the others because of differences in the composition and crystal structures of the materials, and how electrons within these materials respond to a magnetic field. Introduction Ferrimagnetism can be thought of as a combination of ferromagnetism and because of the many similarities between them, but it has important points of difference also. Similar to ferromagnets, ferrimagnets exhibit a spontaneous magnetic moment (i.e., a magnetic moment even in the absence of a magnetic field) and hysteresis below their Curie temperature, and behave paramagnetically above the Curie temperature. On the other hand, similar to the magnetic moments of ferrimagnets align antiparallel to one another, the difference being that the net magnetic moment is non-zero. Ferrimagnetic materials are thus differentiated from ferromagnetic and materials by the arrangement of their magnetic moments, and the dependence of the resulting magnetic properties on temperature, which depend on the types of elements in the\n",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES Identify the types of sugars involved in glucose metabolism KEY TAKEAWAYS Key Points When blood sugar levels drop, glycogen is broken down into glucose -1-phosphate, which is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate and enters glycolysis for ATP production. In the liver, galactose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate in order to enter the glycolytic pathway. Fructose is converted into glycogen in the liver and then follows the same pathway as glycogen to enter glycolysis. Sucrose is broken down into glucose and fructose; glucose enters the pathway directly while fructose is converted to glycogen. Key Terms disaccharide: A sugar, such as sucrose, maltose, or lactose, consisting of two combined together. glycogen: A polysaccharide that is the main form of carbohydrate storage in animals; converted to glucose as needed.

      "General Discussion The floating-point data type is a family of data types that act alike and differ only in the size of their domains (the allowable values). The floating-point family of data types represent number values with fractional parts. They are technically stored as two integer values: a mantissa and an exponent. The floating-point family has the same attributes and acts or behaves similarly in all programming languages. They can always store negative or positive values thus they always are signed; unlike the integer data type that could be unsigned. The domain for floating-point data types varies because they could represent very large numbers or very small numbers. Rather than talk about the actual values, we mention the precision. The more bytes of storage the larger the mantissa and exponent, thus more precision. The most often used floating-point family data type used in C++ is the double. By default, most compilers convert floating-point constants into the double data type for use in calculations. The double data type will store just about any number most beginning programmers will ever encounter. | C++ Reserved Word | double | | Represent | Numbers with fractional parts | | Size | Usually 8\n",

      "I refer here to pincushion or barrel distortion introduced by the optical system. This results in a displacement of the stellar images towards or away from the plate centre. Unlike differential refraction or aberration of light, the stellar displacements are symmetric with respect to inversion through the plate centre. This is also true of the optical aberration known as coma. A comatic stellar image results in a displacement of the centre of the stellar image away from the plate centre. Thus we can deal with distortion and coma in a similar manner. This can be best dealt with by assuming a quadratic relation for the difference between true and measured coordinates: \\[ξ − x = ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c, \\[η − y = a^\\prime x^2 + 2h^\\prime xy + b^\\prime y^2 + 2g^\\prime x + f^\\prime y + c^\\prime .

      "Summary: For a function to be continuous at a point, it must be defined at that point, its limit must exist at the point, and the value of the function at that point must equal the value of the limit at that point. may be classified as removable, jump, or infinite. A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. It is continuous over a closed interval if it is continuous at every point in its interior and is continuous at its endpoints. Many functions have the property that their graphs can be traced with a pencil without lifting the pencil from the page. Such functions are called continuous. Other functions have points at which a break in the graph occurs, but satisfy this property over intervals contained in their domains. They are continuous on these intervals and are said to have a discontinuity at a point where a break occurs. We begin our investigation of continuity by exploring what it means for a function to have continuity at a point. Intuitively, a function is continuous at a particular point if there is no break in its graph at that\n",

      "Cascade of events: A transmembrane receptor OR a cytoplasmic protein WITH ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY (guanylate cyclase) binds an extracellular chemical signal (for the transmembrane receptor) or an intracellular ligand (for the cytoplasmic protein receptor), causing a conformational change in the receptor. The bound receptor is now a guanylate cyclase which converts GTP into cyclic GMP. This second messenger, like cAMP which binds to and activates PKA, binds to and activates protein kinase (PKG). An example of a hormone which works through a transmembrane receptor is atrial naturetic factor, which binds to a cell-surface receptor whose shape change is communicated to the intracellular receptor domain through the single transmembrane helix, leading to the activation of the intracelluar guanylate cyclase domain of the protein. Likewise, nitric oxide, NO, a gaseous ligand formed from Arg, can diffuse through the cell membrane, where it binds to the heme of a cytoplasmic cyclase which form cGMP, leading to activation of PKG.

This substance was present as a contaminant in the herbicide agent orange, which was so widely used during the Vietnam war. Figure 12.13.1: Structure of When ingested or injected, TCDD is extremely poisonous to laboratory animals. At sub-lethal it causes cancer and birth defects in them. Exposure to high levels of dioxins causes a severe skin disease (chloracne) in humans as well as damage to the liver and nervous system. While the evidence is still hotly debated, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is convinced that dioxins cause cancer in humans. They base this conclusion on extrapolating from dose-response studies done in animals (rats) and following the health of industrial workers who were exposed to dioxins in the U.S., Germany, and the Netherlands. Thanks to the development of delicate analytical techniques, it is possible to detect trace amounts in everyone's blood. Most of us have a few parts per trillion (ppt) of TCDD in our serum.

      "IPv4 has run out of large address blocks, as of 2011. IPv6 has reached a mature level of development. Most common operating systems provide excellent IPv6 support. Yet conversion has been slow. Many ISPs still provide limited (to nonexistent) support, and inexpensive IPv6 firewalls to replace the ubiquitous consumer-grade NAT routers are just beginning to appear. Time will tell how all this evolves. However, while IPv6 has now been around for twenty years, top-level IPv4 address blocks disappeared much more recently.

      "An interface is like a contract between a function and a caller. The caller agrees to provide certain parameters and the function agrees to do certain work. For example, polyline requires four arguments: t has to be a Turtle; n has to be an integer; length should be a positive number; and angle has to be a number, which is understood to be in degrees. These requirements are called preconditions because they are supposed to be true before the function starts executing. Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are Postconditions include the intended effect of the function (like drawing line segments) and any side effects (like moving the Turtle or making other changes). Preconditions are the responsibility of the caller. If the caller violates a (properly documented!) precondition and the function doesn’t work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not the function. If the preconditions are satisfied and the postconditions are not, the bug is in the function. If your pre- and postconditions are clear, they can help with debugging.\n",

      "Nuclear energy is energy in the nucleus (core) of an atom (see chapter 1 for a review of atomic structure). There is enormous energy in the forces that hold protons and neutrons in the nucleus together. Energy is released when those forces are broken. Nuclear energy can be released from atoms by splitting apart the nucleus of an atom to form smaller atoms, a process known as nuclear fission. During nuclear fission, a small atomic particle called a neutron hits the uranium atom and splits it, releasing a great amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. More neutrons are also released when the uranium atom splits. These neutrons go on to bombard other uranium atoms, and the process repeats itself over and over again. This is called a chain reaction (Figure Nuclear power plants use the energy from nuclear fission to produce electricity. Figure Fission chain reaction – begins when a neutron bombards a U-235 atom, splitting it into two fission fragments, along with more neutrons and energy. The neutrons bombard other uranium atoms releasing more energy and more neutrons and the reaction continues. 4.7.1: Nuclear fuel processing Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element that decays\n",

      "LEARNING OBJECTIVES Describe signal summation Each neuron connects with numerous other neurons, often receiving multiple impulses from them. Sometimes, a single excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential. Summation, either spatial or temporal, is the addition of these impulses at the axon hillock. Together, synaptic summation and the threshold for excitation act as a filter so that random “noise” in the system is not transmitted as important information. Signal summation at the axon hillock: A single neuron can receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from multiple neurons. All these inputs are added together at the axon hillock. If the EPSPs are strong enough to overcome the IPSPs and reach the threshold of excitation, the neuron will fire. One neuron often has input from many presynaptic neurons, whether excitatory or inhibitory; therefore, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa. The net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an action potential.\n",

      "There are alternatives to using op amp based integrators and As long as systems can be described by a reasonable set of equations, simulation using digital computers is possible. The primary advantages of a digital computer-based simulation scheme is that it is very flexible and potentially very accurate. Before the rise of affordable and powerful desktop digital computers, the speed of response of the digital technique was a severe limitation. Analog computers can be configured as real-time or faster-than-real-time devices: they respond at the same speed or faster than the system that is being simulated. The typically heavy computation load of the digital computer requires prodigious calculation speed to keep up with reasonably fast processes. Fortunately, this is no longer the problem it once was. Another advantage of the analog computer is its immediacy. It is by nature, interactive. This means that an operator can change simulation parameters and immediately see the result. Finally, there are some applications for which the added cost of the computing hardware cannot be justified. If these are not issues, then a digital-based simulation will most likely be preferred. The general idea is to calculate the response for several closely spaced points in time.\n",

      "A microbe that is capable of causing disease is referred to as a pathogen, while the organism being infected is called a host. The ability to cause disease is referred to as pathogenicity, with pathogens varying in their ability. An opportunistic pathogen is a microbe that typically infects a host that is compromised in some way, either by a weakened immune system or breach to the body’s natural defenses, such as a wound. The measurement of pathogenicity is called virulence, with highly virulent pathogens being more likely to cause disease in a host. It is important to remember that there are many variables to take into account in a host-pathogen interaction, which is a dynamic relationship that is constantly changing. The virulence of the pathogen is important, but so is the number of microbes that gained entry to the host, the location of entry, the overall health of the host, and the state of the host’s defenses. Exposure to a pathogen does not ensure that disease will occur, since a host might be able to fight off the infection before disease signs/symptoms develop. Host-Pathogen Interactions.

      "Skills to Develop Explain field tensor The electric field Section 10.1 showed that relativity requires magnetic forces to exist, and section 10.2 gave us a peek at what this implies about or how electric and magnetic fields transform. To understand this on a more general basis, let’s explicitly list some assumptions about the electric field and see how they lead to the existence and properties of a magnetic field: Definition of the electric field: In the frame of reference of an inertial observer \\(o\\), take some standard, charged test particle, release it at rest, and observe the force (section 4.5) acting on the particle. (The timelike component of this force vanishes.) Then the electric field three-vector \\(E\\) in frame \\(o\\) is defined by = qE\\), where we fix our system of units by taking some arbitrary value for the charge \\(q\\) of the test particle. Definition of electric charge: For charges other than the standard test charge, we take Gauss’s law to be our definition of electric charge. Charge is Lorentz invariant (section 1.3). Fields must have transformation laws (section 10.2). Many times already in our study of relativity, we’ve followed the strategy of taking a Galilean vector and\n",

      "To understand how a household will make its choices, economists look at what consumers can afford, as shown in\n",

      "constraint line, the quantity of one good is on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good on the vertical\n",
      "axis. The budget constraint line shows the various combinations of two goods that are affordable given consumer\n",
      "income. Consider José's situation, shown in Figure 6.2. José likes to collect T-shirts and watch movies.\n",
      "In Figure 6.2 we show the quantity of T-shirts on the horizontal axis while we show the quantity of movies on the\n",
      "vertical axis. If José had unlimited income or goods were free, then he could consume without limit. However, José,\n",
      "like all of us, faces a budget constraint. José has a total of $56 to spend. The price of T-shirts is $14 and the price\n",
      "of movies is $7. Notice that the vertical intercept of the budget constraint line is at eight movies and zero T-shirts\n",
      "($56/$7=8). The horizontal intercept of the budget constraint is four, where José spends of all of his money on T-shirts\n",
      "and no movies ($56/14=4). The slope of the budget constraint line is rise/run or –8/4=–2. The specific choices along\n",
      "the budget constraint line show the combinations of affordable T-shirts and movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 6.2 A Choice between Consumption Goods José has income of $56. Movies cost $7 and T-shirts cost\n",
      "$14. The points on the budget constraint line show the combinations of affordable movies and T-shirts.\n",
      "\n",
      "José wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest utility, which is the term economists\n",
      "use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction or happiness with his or her choices.\n",
      "Let’s begin with an assumption, which we will discuss in more detail later, that José can measure his own utility with\n",
      "something called utils. (It is important to note that you cannot make comparisons between the utils of individuals.\n",
      "If one person gets 20 utils from a cup of coffee and another gets 10 utils, this does not mean than the first person\n",
      "gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as much. The reason why\n",
      "is that utils are subjective to an individual. The way one person measures utils is not the same as the way someone\n",
      "else does.) Table 6.2 shows how José’s utility is connected with his T-shirt or movie consumption. The first column\n",
      "of the table shows the quantity of T-shirts consumed. The second column shows the total utility, or total amount of\n",

      "\n",
      "Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices\n",
      "\n",
      "satisfaction, that José receives from consuming that number of T-shirts. The most common pattern of total utility,\n",
      "in this example, is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility, but at a decreasing rate. The third\n",
      "column shows marginal utility, which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption. This\n",
      "equation for marginal utility is:\n",
      "MU =\n",
      "\n",
      "change in total utility\n",
      "change in quantity\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed, which means that each subsequent unit of\n",
      "a good consumed provides less additional utility. For example, the first T-shirt José picks is his favorite and it gives\n",
      "him an addition of 22 utils. The fourth T-shirt is just something to wear when all his other clothes are in the wash and\n",
      "yields only 18 additional utils. This is an example of the law of diminishing marginal utility, which holds that the\n",
      "additional utility decreases with each unit added. Diminishing marginal utility is another example of the more general\n",
      "law of diminishing returns we learned earlier in the chapter on Choice in a World of Scarcity.\n",
      "The rest of Table 6.2 shows the quantity of movies that José attends, and his total and marginal utility from seeing\n",
      "each movie. Total utility follows the expected pattern: it increases as the number of movies that José watches rises.\n",
      "Marginal utility also follows the expected pattern: each additional movie brings a smaller gain in utility than the\n",
      "previous one. The first movie José attends is the one he wanted to see the most, and thus provides him with the highest\n",
      "level of utility or satisfaction. The fifth movie he attends is just to kill time. Notice that total utility is also the sum of\n",

      "If the last T-shirt provides more than twice the marginal utility of the last movie, then the T-shirt is providing more\n",
      "“bang for the buck” or marginal utility per dollar, than if the money were spent on movies. As a result, José should\n",

      "same for both goods. This is a tell-tale signal that José has found the point with highest total utility.\n",
      "We can write this argument as a general rule: If you always choose the item with the greatest marginal utility per\n",

      "Step 2. Products, however, usually cost more than a dollar, so we cannot trade a dollar’s worth of movies. The\n",

      "But a new group of economists, known as behavioral economists, argue that the traditional method leaves out\n",
      "something important: people’s state of mind. For example, one can think differently about money if one is feeling\n",
      "revenge, optimism, or loss. These are not necessarily irrational states of mind, but part of a range of emotions\n",
      "that can affect anyone on a given day. And what’s more, actions under these conditions are indeed predictable, if\n",

      "The way the mind works, according to this view, may seem inconsistent to traditional economists but is actually far\n",
      "more complex than an unemotional cost-benefit adding machine. For example, a traditional economist would say\n",
      "that if you lost a $10 bill today, and also got an extra $10 in your paycheck, you should feel perfectly neutral. After\n",
      "all, –$10 + $10 = $0. You are the same financially as you were before. However, behavioral economists have done\n",

      "things happen. We tend to focus more on the loss than the gain. This is known as loss aversion, where a $1 loss\n",
      "pains us 2.25 times more than a $1 gain helps us, according to the economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky\n",
      "in a famous 1979 article in the journal Econometrica. This insight has implications for investing, as people tend\n",
      "to “overplay” the stock market by reacting more to losses than to gains. Indeed, this behavior looks irrational to\n",
      "traditional economists, but is consistent once we understand better how the mind works, these economists argue.\n",
      "Traditional economists also assume human beings have complete self-control. But, for instance, people will buy\n",
      "cigarettes by the pack instead of the carton even though the carton saves them money, to keep usage down. They\n",
      "purchase locks for their refrigerators and overpay on taxes to force themselves to save. In other words, we protect\n",
      "ourselves from our worst temptations but pay a price to do so. One way behavioral economists are responding to\n",

      "20 percent of new employees do not enroll in retirement savings plans immediately, because of procrastination or\n",

      "are automatically enrolled unless they “opt out.” Almost no-one opts out in this program and employees begin saving\n",
      "at the early years, which are most critical for retirement.\n",
      "Another area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting, or putting dollars in different mental categories\n",
      "where they take different values. Economists typically consider dollars to be fungible, or having equal value to the\n",
      "individual, regardless of the situation.\n",
      "You might, for instance, think of the $25 you found in the street differently from the $25 you earned from three\n",
      "hours working in a fast food restaurant. The street money might well be treated as “mad money” with little rational\n",
      "regard to getting the best value. This is in one sense strange, since it is still equivalent to three hours of hard work\n",
      "in the restaurant. Yet the “easy come-easy go” mentality replaces the rational economizer because of the situation, or\n",
      "context, in which the money was attained.\n",
      "In another example of mental accounting that seems inconsistent to a traditional economist, a person could carry a\n",
      "credit card debt of $1,000 that has a 15% yearly interest cost, and simultaneously have a $2,000 savings account\n",
      "that pays only 2% per year. That means she pays $150 a year to the credit card company, while collecting only $40\n",
      "annually in bank interest, so she loses $130 a year. That doesn’t seem wise.\n",
      "The “rational” decision would be to pay off the debt, since a $1,000 savings account with $0 in debt is the equivalent\n",
      "net worth, and she would now net $20 per year. But curiously, it is not uncommon for people to ignore this advice,\n",
      "since they will treat a loss to their savings account as higher than the benefit of paying off their credit card. The dollars\n",
      "are not being treated as fungible so it looks irrational to traditional economists.\n",
      "Which view is right, the behavioral economists’ or the traditional view? Both have their advantages, but behavioral\n",

      "There are three major checkpoints for cell cycle control (Figure 1). The first regulates the transition from G1 to S phase. Recall that G1 can be a very long phase, even (in the case of G0) as long as the lifespan of the cell. However, once the cell reaches S phase, it is committed to going through S, G2, and M phases to reproduce. This is because once S phase has begun, there is more than the normal diploid complement of DNA inside the cell. Over time this would confuse the cell (e.g., by overexpression of duplicated genes) as it tried to use the DNA to direct RNA and protein synthesis, and it could become sick and die. The second major checkpoint regulates entry into mitosis. Once mitosis begins, most of the metabolic activity of the cell is shut down, and the cell concentrates its resources on dividing the nuclear and cellular material equally to support the life of both resulting daughter cells. If the cell needs more time to make final repairs on the DNA or even to bulk up a little, this checkpoint can hold the cell in G2 a little longer for those things to happen. Finally, the third major checkpoint occurs during mitosis, and regulates the transition from metaphase into anaphase. Since the sister chromatids are being split apart and moved to opposite poles to form the new nuclei, it is important that all of them are perfectly lined up at metaphase and the proteins holding them together have dropped off. If they do not split evenly, the daughter cells will have abnormal numbers of chromosomes (aneuploidy) usually leading to deleterious consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the molecular mechanism that regulates the progress of the cell cycle? While many of the checkpoint sensing mechanisms are still unclear, they seem to converge on two sets of proteins that act together to trigger cell cycle advancement. These proteins are known as the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk). As the names suggest, the cyclins are proteins that regulate progression through the cell cycle, and must be present in sufficient concentration to help activate the appropriate cdk. The cyclin-dependent kinase is the active, enzymatic, half of the partnership, and activates other enzymes by phosphorylation. Although the cyclins appear to be necessary for cdk activation, they are not sufficient, as there are intermediate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps required to activate the cdk after cyclin binding. Both the cyclins and the cdk’s are families of related proteins, and they can combine in different ways to govern particular points in the cell cycle (Figure 2). Interestingly, the intracellular level of cdks is fairly constant. The level of cyclins, on the other hand, uctuates dramatically depending on the state of the cell with respect to the cell cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 2. Cyclins are involved in control of the cell cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The methodology of some of the early experiments is perfectly suited to explaining how this works. The seminal paper in this field was a 1971 paper in J. Exp. Zool. by Masui and Markert. In it, they examined frog (Xenopus laevis) eggs that were arrested at G2. The oocytes arrest for about 8 months naturally in order to build up the mass needed to start a new organism once it has been fertilized. The basic question being asked is what is causing the eggs to come out of G2 and into M phase? It was already known that the hormone progesterone can trigger this transition, but what are the intracellular players in the change in cell state? Masui and Markert decided to test whether there was a cytoplasmic molecule that was responsible. They took a small amount of cytoplasm from an M-phase egg and injected it into a G2-arrested egg. This triggered the maturation of the G2-arrested egg and pushed it into M phase, even without progesterone. The activity was called maturation promoting factor (MPF), and was hypothesized to be a soluble, cytosolic protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "In later experiments, other investigators attempted to find the specific protein trigger, and from there, presumably, the rest of the mechanism. Fractionating the M-phase oocyte cytoplasm by column chromatography, a protein, named cyclin B, was found to rise and fall in concentration in direct synchronization with MPF activity. Furthermore, addition of cyclin B alone was sufficient to rescue MPF activity from M-phase cytoplasmic extract that had been depleted by RNase treatment (preventing synthesis of any new proteins, including cyclin B, and abolishing MPF activity). This clearly places cyclin B in the forefront of the maturation mechanism, but there was one major issue: cyclin B had no enzymatic activity. How was it effecting the changes needed for progress from G2 to M phase?\n",
      "\n",
      "This problem was answered by experiments on a very different organism, the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Because they have a very short cycle time, a relatively small genome, and they can be given random mutations en masse by irradiation or chemical treatment, yeast are excellent model organisms for many types of biological study. After random mutation of a population of yeast, they can be screened for mutations of particular types, such as cell division cycle (cdc). When the mutations are sequenced and identified, they are often named by the type of mutation and order of discovery. Cdc2, it turns out, showed two interesting phenotypes when mutated in opposite directions. Mutations that knocked out function of cdc2 caused the formation of extremely large yeast that do not undergo cell division, while mutations that made cdc2 overactive caused the formation of rapidly dividing very small cells. The interpretation was that when cdc2 is missing or inactive, the cells cannot progress to mitosis, so they stay in G2 accumulating bulk material in preparation for a cell split that never comes. Conversely, when cdc2 is overactive, it drives the cell quickly into mitosis, even if it has not been in G2 long enough to synthesize enough mass to form two normal-sized cells. This ties cdc2 nicely to cell cycle regulation, and it even has an enzymatic activity: it is a kinase. This made it a perfect candidate as a first-order coordinator of cellular events because phosphorylation is fast, phosphorylation usually activates some other enzyme, and kinases usually act on an array of targets, not just one. So we now have a cyclin (identified as cdc13 in S. pombe) and a cyclin-dependent kinase that work together to promote cell cycle progression into M phase.\n",

      "The most common symptoms of meningitis are headache and neck stiffness associated with fever, confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light (photophobia) or loud noises (phonophobia). Children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability and drowsiness. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis. For instance, meningitis caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (known as “meningococcal menigitis”) can be differentiated from meningitis with other causes by a rapidly spreading petechial rash, which may precede other symptoms. The rash consists of numerous small, irregular purple or red spots (“petechiae”) on the trunk, lower extremities, mucous membranes, conjuctiva, and (occasionally) the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. Meningococcal bacteria may be accompanied by a characteristic rash. Seizures may also occur for various reasons. In children, seizures are common in the early stages of meningitis and do not necessarily indicate an underlying cause.\n",

      "Neck stiffness: Neck stiffness, Texas meningitis epidemic of 1911–12. Nuchal rigidity occurs in 70% of bacterial meningitis in adults.\n",

      "Meningitis can lead to serious long-term consequences such as deafness, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and cognitive deficits, especially if not treated quickly. Some forms of meningitis (such as those associated with meningococci, Haemophilus influenzae type B, pneumococci, or mumps virus infections) may be prevented by immunization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meningitis is typically caused by an infection with microorganisms. Most infections are due to viruses (such as enteroviruses or herpes simplex virus), with bacteria (for example group B streptococci), fungi, and protozoa being the next most common causes. It may also result from various non-infectious causes. The term aseptic meningitis refers to cases of meningitis in which no bacterial infection can be demonstrated. This type of meningitis is usually caused by viruses, but it may be due to bacterial infection that has already been partially treated, when bacteria disappear from the meninges, or pathogens infect a space adjacent to the meninges (e.g. sinusitis). Endocarditis (an infection of the heart valves which spreads small clusters of bacteria through the bloodstream) may cause aseptic meningitis. Aseptic meningitis may also result from infection with spirochetes, a type of bacteria that includes Treponema pallidum (the cause of syphilis) and Borrelia burgdorferi (known for causing Lyme disease).\n",
      "\n",
      "A lumbar puncture diagnoses or excludes meningitis. A needle is inserted into the spinal canal to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which envelops the brain and spinal cord. The CSF is examined in a medical laboratory. In someone suspected of having meningitis, blood tests are performed for markers of inflammation (e.g. C-reactive protein, complete blood count) as well as blood cultures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first treatment in acute meningitis consists of antimicrobial and sometimes antiviral therapy. In addition, corticosteroids can also be used to prevent complications from excessive inflammation. The introduction of pneumococcal vaccine has lowered rates of pneumococcal meningitis in both children and adults. Recent skull trauma potentially allows nasal cavity bacteria to enter the meningeal space. Similarly, devices in the brain and meninges such as cerebral shunts carry an increased risk of meningitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bacterial and viral meningitis are contagious and can be transmitted through droplets of respiratory secretions during close contact such as kissing, sneezing, or coughing on someone, but cannot be spread by only breathing the air where a person with meningitis has been. Since the 1980’s, many countries have included immunization against Haemophilus influenzae type B in their routine childhood vaccination schemes. This has practically eliminated this pathogen as a cause of meningitis in young children in those countries.\n",

Charles (1970) states that this cannot be true, since in general the excess head losses will approach the excess head losses matching the ELM. In other words, for very high line speeds the hydraulic gradient should be determined with the Darcy Weisbach equation, replacing the density of the pure liquid with the mixture density.

The definition points to the spatial concentration, however most researchers have used the delivered concentration. A second assumption as used by Babcock (1970) is adopted from Durand & Condolios (1952), the size independence assumption for coarse particles. Stating that the excess hydraulic gradient is independent of the particle size above a certain particle diameter. The purpose of the research of Babcock (1970) was to verify these assumptions. The research was carried out in a 0.0254 m diameter pipe (1 inch). The first experiments were carried out with a 20/30 mesh quartz sand (coarse).

The tests were carried out in a 1 inch pipe with d=0.20 mm and d=0.55 mm sand. The Fr-1=√Cx is determined with the Gibert (1960) graph. The data points seem to be parallel to the Newitt et al.

      "Bacteriophages capable of a lysogenic life cycle are termed temperate bacteriophages. When a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterium, it can either replicate by means of the lytic life cycle and cause lysis of the host bacterium, or, it can incorporate its DNA into the bacterium's DNA and become a noninfectious prophage (see Fig. 1) (http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/lecguide/unit4/viruses/u2fig18.html). In the latter case, the cycle begins by the bacteriophage adsorbing to the host bacterium or lysogen and injecting its genome as in the lytic life cycle (see Fig. 2 (http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/lecguide/unit4/viruses/u2fig18a.html) and Fig. 3 (http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/lecguide/unit4/viruses/u2fig18b.html)). However, the bacteriophage does not shut down the host cell. Instead, the bacteriophage DNA inserts or integrates into the host bacterium's DNA (see Fig. 4) (http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/lecguide/unit4/viruses/u2fig18c.html). At this stage the virus is called a prophage. Expression of the bacteriophage genes controlling bacteriophage replication is blocked by a repressor protein, and the phage DNA replicates as a part of the bacterium's DNA so that every daughter bacterium now contains the prophage (see Fig. 5) (http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/lecguide/unit4/viruses/u2fig18d.html).\n",

      "Gram staining (or Gram’s method; is a method of differentiating bacterial species into two large groups (Gram-positive and Gram-negative ). It is based on the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls. Primarily, it detects peptidoglycan, which is present in a thick layer in Gram positive bacteria. A Gram positive results in a purple/blue color while a Gram negative results in a pink/red color. The Gram stain is almost always the first step in the identification of a bacterial organism, and is the default stain performed by laboratories over a sample when no specific culture is referred. While Gram staining is a valuable diagnostic tool in both clinical and research settings, not all bacteria can be definitively classified by this technique, thus forming Gram-variable and Gram-indeterminate groups as well.\n",

      "A broad spectrum antibiotic acts against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, in contrast to a narrow spectrum antibiotic, which is effective against specific families of bacteria. An example of a commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotic is ampicillin. Broad spectrum antibiotics are properly used in the following medical situations: empirically (i.e., based on the experience of the practitioner), prior to the formal identification of the causative bacteria and when there is a wide range of possible illnesses and a potentially serious illness would result if treatment is delayed. This occurs, for example, in meningitis, where the patient can become fatally ill within hours if broad-spectrum antibiotics are not initiated. Broad spectrum antibiotics are also used for drug resistant bacteria that do not respond to other, more narrow spectrum antibiotics and in the case of superinfections, where there are multiple types of bacteria causing illness, thus warranting either a broad-spectrum antibiotic or combination antibiotic therapy.\n",

      "Statistical events generate two types of outcomes: continuous or discrete. Continuous outcomes can take an infinite number of values; for instance, a person's height can take any real number, so there are infinite possibilities. Typical events generating continuous outcomes may follow a normal, exponential, or geometric distribution. Discrete outcomes can only on take prescribed values; for instance, a dice roll can only generate an integer between 1 to 6. Discrete outcomes are typically distributed either binomially or multinomially. It is with multinomial distribution that this article is concerned.\n",

      "Multinomial Distributions: Mathematical Representation\n",

      "Multinomial distributions specifically deal with events that have multiple discrete outcomes. The Binomial distribution is a specific subset of multinomial distributions in which there are only two possible outcomes to an event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multinomial distributions are not limited to events only having discrete outcomes. It is possible to categorize outcomes with continuous distributions to different degrees (high, medium, low). For instance, the water level - a continuous entity - in a storage tank can be made discrete by categorizing them into either \"desirable\" or \"not desirable.\" Multinomial distributions, therefore, have expansive applications in process control.\n",

      "We know that the the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes that can occur in a trial must be unity (since one outcome must occur). The probability density function yields this result for both continuous and discrete outcomes. However, it is important to note that to get this result for continuous outcomes, one must take the integral of the probability density function over all possible outcomes. To get this unity result for discrete outcomes, one must sum the probabilities of each outcome (similar to taking Riemann sums (https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus/Book%3A_Calculus_(Apex)/05%3A_Integration/5.03%3A_Riemann_Sums)).\n",

      "Statistics have historically been useful in descriptive and inferential analysis of data. Likewise, multinomial distribution is also applicable to the aforementioned areas: descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and six-sigma. Several key variables are used in these applications:\n",
      "\n",
      "The expected value below describes the mean of the data. Discrete random variables can take on a range of values; the mean of the data describes the location of the data within this range.\n",

      "Derivation of Binomial Distribution\n",
      "\n",
      "As was stated above, the binomial distribution is simply a special case of the multinomial distribution. Using the multinomial distribution, the probability of obtaining two events n1 and n2 with respective probabilities \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) from \\(N\\) total is given by:\n",

      "If we label the event of interest, say n1 in this case, as \"k,\" then, since only two outcomes are possible, n2 must equal N-k. Finally, If we label the probability of obtaining k as simply \"p,\" then the probability of obtaining event n2 (p2) must be 1-p, because again only two outcomes are possible. With these subsitutions, the above equation simplifies to\n",

      "Applications of Multinomial Distributions\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned before, multinomial distributions are a generalized version of binomial distributions. In chemical engineering applications, multinomial distributions are relevant to situations where there are more than two possible outcomes (temperature = {high, med, low}). Multinomial systems are a useful analysis tool when a “success-failure” description is insufficient to understand the system. A continuous form of the multinomial distribution is the Dirichlet distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using Bayes' Rule is one of the major applications of multinomial distributions. For example, Bayes' Rule can be used to predict the pressure of a system given the temperature and statistical data for the system. Bayes' Rule can be used to determine the probability of an event or outcome as mentioned above. Additional details on Bayes' Rule can be found at Bayes' Rule, conditional probability, independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bayes' Rule Example\n",
      "\n",
      "In case you’ve forgotten how to use Bayes’ Rule, here is an example that shows how to use it to solve a problem with a multinomial outcome which results from combining dual possibilities (such as desired flow vs. undesired flow and configuration A vs. configuration B).\n",
      "\n",
      "You are given a flow apparatus with two possible specific valve configurations, A and B. For specific valve configuration A, desired flow rates are achieved 98.5% of the time. And for specific valve configuration B, the desired flow rates are achieved 89.3% of the time. An operator might use the configuration from A 79% of the time when desired flow rates are achieved. Can you determine the probability that a randomly chosen configuration is the same as the one in specific valve configuration B and produces undesirable flow rates?\n",

      "Big animals like elephants, lions, and whales tend to produce minimal number of offspring but increase the child care to ensure survival. This is called K-strategy, this is opposite to r-strategy usually smaller creatures which employs big numbers of offspring, and most of them will not survive (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)).\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) K-strategic elephant and r-strategic (like codfish) elephant. The second does not exist. Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Analogously, bigger plants would need to do the same as K-strategic animals: make few daughter plants but defend and supply them with all needs until they mature. However, big secondary thickening spore plants were not capable of family planning; they still made billions of spores and then left them to fend for themselves. Naturally, only few from these billions would survive to become fertilized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spore reproduction is cheap and efficient but as birth control is not available, results are unpredictable. Even worse, these spore tree forests were not at all stable: in accidentally good conditions, many spores would survive and make sporophytes which start to grow simultaneously and then suppress each other and even die from over-population. But if the environmental conditions are bad, then none of the gametophytes will survive so there would be no new saplings to replace the old trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is similar to the so-called “dinosaur problem”. This situation arose when giant Mesozoic reptiles also lost the control for their offspring: their egg size was limited due to physical restrictions, therefore, young dinosaurs were so much smaller than adults; then the only possible strategy was to leave them alone (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)). As a result, at the end of Mesozoic dinosaurs either decreased in size (became birds), or went extinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) How dinosaurs and ferns solved the problem of conflicting strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plants, however, kept their size and survived. This is because they developed the seed (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)). A seed is the result of enforced control of the sporophyte over the gametophyte. The idea of a seed is to hide most of the heterosporous life cycle inside mother plant (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)). In seed plants, everything happens directly on the mother sporophyte: growing of gametophytes, syngamy, and growing of daughter sporophyte. Consequently, the female spore (megaspore) never leaves the sporangium. It germinates inside, waits for fertilization and then the zygote grows into and embryo, still inside the same sporangium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) How secondary thickening, heterospory and seed are connected: challenges to land plants and their responses. This is part 2, part 1 is on Figure 5.1.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will finally leave the mother plant is the whole female sporangium with gametophyte and embryo on it. This is the seedchimeric structure with mother (seed coat), daughter (embryo) and endosperm genotypes. It can be defined as chimeric structure with three genotypes: seed coat (mother plant megasporangium, \\(2n\\)), endosperm (female gametophyte, \\(n\\)), and daughter sporophyte (embryo, \\(2n\\)).\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted here that flowering plants have endosperm of different origin; it is called endosperm\\(_2\\) and usually is triploid (\\(3n\\)) whereas female gametophyte endosperm is haploid (\\(n\\)) endosperm\\(_1\\)haploid nutrition tissue originated from female gametophyte. The other note is that apart from seed coat (which originates from integumentextra cover of megasporangium(s), megasporangium extra cover(s)), mother sporophyte also gives nucelluswall of megasporangium (wall of megasporangium) which sometimes is used as a feeding tissue for the embryo. This last tissue is called perispermnutrition tissue originated from nucellus (see).\n",
      "\n",
      "One problem is still left. How will sperms reach female gametophyte and egg cell? The target is now high above the ground, on a branch of the giant tree. The only possible solution is pollination. Pollination is the distribution of the whole male gametophytes which are called pollen grains. Plants have no legs so they always need a third party in their sex, this is mostly wind or insects. A pollen grain is not a spore, mother sporophyte cares about male lineage too, and male spore grows into very small male gametophyte. It contains multiple haploid cells; some of which are sperms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lesser problem is: How would these sperms will swim to the egg cell? Some seed plants will excrete the drop of liquid from the top of the ovule (integument(s) + megasporangium), whereas the other, more advanced way is to grow a sperm delivery tool, the pollen tube (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)) made from one of the pollen grain cells. Fertilization with pollen tube is often called siphonogamy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) The origin of seed (see explanation in the text). Sporophyte is on the left, gametophytes and seed—on the right or/and on the top. First stage—isosporic life cycle, second stage—heterosporic life cycle, third stage—seed plant life cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\) Open fertilization in seed plants (left) with the help of liquid extracted by mother plant; and fertilization with pollen tube (right), or siphonogamy, with the help of pollen tube growing from male gametophyte. Among extant seed plants, only cycads and ginkgo have the open fertilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, seed plants with the pollen tube do not have flagella even on male gametes; these cells are spermatia: aflagellate, non-motile male gametes. (Below, we will continue to call all male gametes “sperms”). Pollen tube also allows only two male gametes per gametophyte: in living world, male gametes are usually competing for fertilization—this selects the best genotypes; whereas in higher seed plants, competition is between pollen tubes. Haploid pollen tube grows inside alien tissue of diploid sporophyte, so this growth is extremely slow in many seed plants. However, angiosperms made their pollen tubes grow fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all these revolutionary adaptations, seed plants were first to colonize really dry places, and, in turn, allowed all other life to survive in arid climates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cycle of a seed plant (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)) begins with a sporophyte (\\(2n\\)) and has both the female and male organs where some cells undergo meiosis. Inside the ovule (which is the megasporangium with extra covers), female gametophyte (\\(n\\), future endosperm\\(_1\\)) produces the egg cells. Male gametophytes (pollen grains) ripen in the pollen sacseed plants: microsporangium which is the microsporangium. The pollen sac sends out the pollen grains which meet up with the ovule. The pollen grain then releases the sperms which fertilize the egg cell, and a zygote is formed. The zygote grows into embryo (which uses endosperm as a feeding tissue) and then into the sporophyte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several plant lineages met this “seed challenge”, there were seed lycophytes and also seed “horsetails”. However, seed ferns made it first and became ancestors of seed plants.\n",

      "\n",
      "Seed Structure and Germination\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeds are diverse. For example, in an onion (Allium), a seed (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\)) has endosperm, one cotyledonembryonic leaf (embryonic leaf), radicle (embryonic root), and the lateral embryonic bud (plumula).\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\) Monocot seed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beans (Phaseolus) and other Leguminosae are examples of seeds without endosperm—actually, it was there, but growing embryo usually eats it out completely. These seeds have two large cotyledons. Grass (Gramineae) seeds contain several specific organs, namely coleoptile, coleorhiza, and scutellum. The scutellum is an enlarged cotyledon, coleoptile is the bud cover, and coleorhiza covers the embryonic root, radicle (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{7}\\)). Onion and grasses are monocots with lateral embryonic bud. Other seed plants have a terminal embryonic bud and two or multiple cotyledons. Pine (Pinus) is an example of a plant that has multiple (five or more) cotyledons. Some plants like orchids (Orchidaceae) do not have developed embryo and even endosperm in seeds, their germination depends on a presence of symbiotic (mycorrhizal) fungus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first step in germination and starts with the uptake of water, also known as imbition. After imbition, enzymes are activated that start to break down starch into sugars consumed by embryo. The first indication that germination has begun is a swelling in the radicle. In onion and pea (Pisum), a structure that looks like a hook goes up through the soil and expose cotyledons and both hypocotyl and epicotyl (first internode). In beans, grasses, and palms, only epicotyl is exposed aboveground whereas cotyledons and hypocotyl remain underground.\n",

      "(\"Симфония No 2, 1 част\" от Густав Малер) Този инструмент се нарича английски рог. Английският рог и обоят са братя. Спада към семейството на дървените духови инструменти с двоен платък. Платък е тази част най-отгоре. Изработих си го сам. Най-добре е човек да си го изработи сам, защото така постига по-голям контрол върху звученето на инструмента. Английският рог се изработва от африканското дърво кокоболо. Моят е направен от известен майстор в Ню Йорк, като в неговото ателие работят само трима души. Всичко се прави на ръка, с ръчни инструменти, докато други производители имат автоматизирани машини и компютри, които правят всички отвори. Направата на този инструмент отне повече от година. Платъците се правят от малко тръстиково растение, което расте в Южна Франция. Всъщност то се среща навсякъде, но повечето хора купуват това от Южна Франция, защото традицията така повелява. Английският рог представлява дълга тръба с конична форма. На самия си връх тя е съвсем тясна. Тази извита тръбичка се нарича бокал. Името й на други езици означава \"извита кука\". Силното стеснение на тръбата в горния край ни дава малко повече контрол и придава звучене, наподобяващо тромпет. Това се усеща още по-силно при обоя. Когато клапите се затворят с пръсти, в действителност тръбата се удължава. Например, ако затворя поредни клапи: (изпълнение на гама на английски рог) Колкото повече клапи затварям, толкова повече се удължава тръбата. Колкото по-надолу отиват моите пръсти по тръбата, толкова повече я удължавам, което означава, че тоновете стават по-ниски. (изпълнение на английски рог) Много харесвам този красив и прочувствен звук. Отличава се с голяма изразителност, сравнима с на тази на човешкия глас, защото не свири нито твърде високо, нито твърде ниско. Диапазонът му е сходен с този на човешкия глас. Много хора винаги са обичали звученето на английския рог. Има прекрасни произведения, композирана е чудесна музика за английски рог. (\"Симфония No 9 в ми минор, Оп. 95, 2 част\" от Антонин Дворжак) Симфонията \"Из новия свят\" от Дворжак е нещо като Светия Граал за всеки изпълнител на английски рог. В нея е едно от най-известните сола за английски рог. Сигурно няма човек, който да не е чувал тази мелодия. Тя е образец за това колко красиво може да звучи английския рог. Английският рог има една приятна особеност. Тя е, че не винаги звучи като да е перфектно настроен. Точно като човешкия глас. Свиренето на цигулка и обой може да бъде много технично, педантично и точно, докато английският рог е повече като виолата и виолончелото. Никой не очаква изпълнението да бъде на сто процента правилно. Звукът е много сладък, много топъл, има донякъде характеристиките на фолклорен инструмент. Може би заради това Стравински прибягва до фагот и английски рог, в началото на балета \"Пролетно тайнство\". Искал е да звучи като нещо екзотично, което не можеш да чуеш всеки ден. Може би по същата причина Дворжак избира за своята Девета симфония английския рог, защото има този топъл и древен звук, и не винаги е добре настроен,но все пак звучи много красиво. (\"Симфония No 9 в ми минор, Оп. 95, 2 част\" от Антонин Дворжак) Когато бях дете, родителите ми ни водиха, мен и моя брат, на концерти, и така от малки свикнахме да ходим на симфонични концерти. В мен се появи афинитет към дървените духови инструменти. Много харесвам обоя и обикновено уроците започват точно с него. Английският рог е инструмент, който се изучава на по-късен етап, както, ако свириш на цигулка, после можеш да се прехвърлиш на виола. Започнах да свиря на обой, когато бях на 12 години. Обстоятелствата ме предразполагаха да се упражнявам. Исках да свиря в младежката филхармония, исках да стана най-добрия в училище. Родителите ми ме подкрепяха, но не ми се месеха, не ме принуждаваха да свиря. Всичко бе плод на обстоятелства: едно нещо водеше след себе си до друго. Никой не ме е тласкал към музикална кариера и не ме е насилвал да стана перфектния солист на обой. Просто се наслаждавах на това, което правя. Работех над себе си. Слушах много записи на класическа музика, които дядо ми имаше. Слушах и радио. Много обичах да слушам Бранденбургските концерти на Бах, всеки ден. Чудех се как е възможно някой да измисли нещо подобно! Как изобщо е измислено това красиво трио в първата част? Как е възможно? Беше толкова съвършено. Размишлявах над подобни теми по цели дни, когато бях в седми клас. В училището, в което ходех, може би защото бяхме друго поколение, отивахме на училище и си носехме стероуредби и си пускахме музика на Щраус. После сравнявахме изпълненията на Чикагската и Берлинската филхармония с това на Филаделфийската филхармония. Всички бяхме се увлекли по това. Случи се малко случайно, че започнах работа като изпълнител на английски рог. Явих се на прослушване за симфоничен оркестър в Южна Африка. Имаше две свободни места, и едното беше за заместник на солист-оркестранта на обой, а другото бе за английски рог. Тъкмо по това време си бях купил английски рог, без да има конкретна причина, и така получих мястото. Има дни, когато свиря по-добре на английски рог, но има и дни, когато свиря по-добре на обой. Това зависи от времето, което отделям за всеки инструмент. От гледна точка на техника, ако човек се научи да свири добре на обой, заради което ходих на училище, има възможност да стане и добър изпълнител на английски рог. Същото е като разликата, когато се прехвърляш от цигулка на виола или виолончело например. Интервалите са по-малки, по-тесни, а звукът е доста по-висок, когато се свири на обой или цигулка. Когато човек се прехвърли на английски рог, вибратото има по-широк диапазон, точно както ако от цигулка мине на виолончело. Звъкът е по-топъл. Има по-малко интензитет в звученето. Не трябва да си толкова стегнат и педантичен. И звукът на инструмента е много по-отпускащ (\"Симфония No 2, 1 част\" от Густав Малер)\n",

      "Voiceover: Before we get to exactly how chronic bronchitis happens, I just wanted to review a quick rule of thumb about the body. So this is any opening, the body has to the outside. Let's label this as the outside. And anytime you have an opening and irritants get into the body, it could be, by irritants I mean anything that doesn't belong there that inflames a tissue. A common first defense of the body is to call on the glands which are embedded in tissue. To secrete either liquid or mucous into the space. And the goal is to have this fluid, this mucous mixed with the irritants and eventually flush them out or bring them out. I'm sure you can think of examples of what I'm talking about, like tears. If things get in your eye, it makes your eyes tear, right? So this is a mechanical thing the tears actually flush out the irritant in your eye. And we have snot. I'm sorry this is kind of gross, but if things get in your nose and it's not suppose to be there, the snot has to bring it out. And the third thing which has to do with what we're going to talk about today is of course phlegm. So when things get into your throat or your lungs, the walls of the lungs secrete the mucous which forms a phlegm. Now the system in the lungs also triggers a cough reflex, which so the walls here if you can me drawing in red here. The walls here are lined with smooth muscle, and when the area is being irritated, the smooth muscle spasm and that's how we get the cough reflex to bring the phlegm out. Now keep in mind, I said this is the body's first line of defense. So these are good things to have, you want the body to do this. So chronic bronchitis is basically too much of a good thing. So we have over production of mucous, such that the body cannot clear it too much of a good thing, that's when we have chronic bronchitis. And of course itis just means it's being irritated, and bronch refers to the lungs. So chronic inflammation and irritation of the lungs. Alrighty, let's draw some airway. So we have our trachea, the big stem bronchus branch off into their branches. Here you go, just keep going. There are 20 or 30 branches to this, you get the idea, they keep getting smaller and smaller. It's how our lungs expand. And as you know oxygen goes into our lungs and carbon dioxide from the body gets out. So you have irritants in there flooding what is usually a clear path, then the lungs are not going to like that. One of the most common chronic irritants that we have in our lungs is of course cigarette smoking. So, here we go, we're going to light this cigarette. And where you see a smoke rising from the cigarette is actually billions and billions of particles that can enter and lodge into our lungs. As a response the glands in the side of the walls, they start secreting the mucous. Remember it's part of our normal response to irritation. But of course chronics, we're talking about years and years of constant. Everyday it's like this. Now eventually, what's suppose to be a clear pathway becomes convoluted with the mucous. It's like, if you're drinking through a straw from a cup, instead of having a clear straw, you're sucking on a milkshake. So this milkshake is thick and it's clogging the straw. So you'll have to suck harder and work harder to get through. Likewise, with the mucous, sometimes there's so much build up that it can clog off one little branch of the lungs. So no more gas exchange can take place here and depending on the severity of the disease you can have different areas of the lungs being out of commission because of the mucous. Now of course we always talk about smoking, but there are other things that can lead to chronic bronchitis. One important thing is pollution. Again pollutants are also billions of particles in the air all the time. In some countries that's especially a big problem and chronic bronchitis is very common there. Or we can have coal dust, for people who work in coal mines, or people who work with asbestos. Shipyard workers. The common theme here is it happens when we can inhale irritant and it happens everyday. Now if I just smoke for a few days and I have a lot of mucous, that doesn't qualify me for having chronic bronchitis. The pathophysiology here talks about the overgrowth of the glands. So we actually look for tissue change. Now in a patient, to diagnose chronic bronchitis is usually a clinical diagnosis, which means there are no test, it's just from the story. But we know from examining lungs of people who have passed away, the tissue change actually happens. So I just blew up one branch of the airway here. We'll call this the lumen. The lumen just means the inside of the tube. So the lumen is here, where the air is getting through. So the black space on both sides are the walls of the bronchi. So basically if we take a cross section of our airway, in the middle here is the lumen. And right now I'm going to talk about the wall space of the bronchi. Okay so we have some smooth muscle around the walls. Again this spasm in this is what gives us the cough reflex. And right near the surface close to the lumen we have these layers of glands. They're responsible for the mucous production we've been talking about. As you can see they are right under the surface. The job is to secrete things into the lumen. Okay just for completeness let me draw some irritants in the lumen. Okay. So that's what a normal wall usually looks like. There is a way for us to put a number on this. And we only do this, we've only seen this in people who have passed away and their lungs get caught up in the lab, and we can look under the microscope to see the Reid index. Which is a way to calculate the ratio of the glands, the thickness of the glands to the whole wall. Now normal Reid index is less than 40%. So we can see the thickness here versus the thickness of this whole wall. It should be less than 40% in you or me. And of course in the middle here there are other things like cartilage or connective tissue. We're just going to fill it in a little bit. Now what happens in chronic bronchitis is, the actual thickness of the gland layer grows. So the glands start proliferating, because we need so much mucous that the original number is not enough, so the body is recruited to make more glands and they extend towards the smooth muscle. So in chronic bronchitis, the Reid index is usually over 50%. So definitely more than half of the thickness of the whole wall is made of glands. Now remember we cannot do this in living people because we have to cut away their lungs. So just a way for us to put a number on this disease, but usually the patients are diagnosed and treated according to their symptoms. And the symptoms all come from this tissue change and the over production of mucous.\n",

As a rider in the car, you feel a pull toward the outside of the track because you are constantly turning. This sensation acts in the opposite direction of centripetal acceleration.

These laws also apply to other objects in the solar system in orbit around the Sun, such as comets (e.g., Halley’s comet) and asteroids. Variations of these laws apply to satellites in orbit around Earth.\n",

We therefore write 1 A.U. = 93,000,000 mi. Since the time it takes for Earth to orbit the Sun is 1 year, we use Earth years for units of time.

Now that we have a formula relating the maximum speed of the car and the banking angle, we are in a position to answer the questions like the one posed at the beginning of the project.     The Bristol Motor Speedway is a NASCAR short track in Bristol, Tennessee. The track has the approximate shape shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{7}\\). Each end of the track is approximately semicircular, so when cars make turns they are traveling along an approximately circular curve. If a car takes the inside track and speeds along the bottom of turn 1, the car travels along a semicircle of radius approximately 211 ft with a banking angle of 24°. If the car decides to take the outside track and speeds along the top of turn 1, then the car travels along a semicircle with a banking angle of 28°. (The track has variable angle banking.)\n",

      "\n",
      "The next two labs deal with the inhibition, destruction, and removal of microorganisms. Control of microorganisms is essential in order to prevent the transmission of diseases and infection, stop decomposition and spoilage, and prevent unwanted microbial contamination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microorganisms are controlled by means of physical agents and chemical agents. Physical agents include such methods of control as high or low temperature, desiccation, osmotic pressure, radiation, and filtration. Control by chemical agents refers to the use of disinfectants, antiseptics, antibiotics, and chemotherapeutic antimicrobial chemicals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basic terms used in discussing the control of microorganisms include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sterilization  Sterilization is the process of destroying all living organisms and viruses. A sterile object is one free of all life forms, including bacterial endospores, as well as viruses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Disinfection  Disinfection is the elimination of microorganisms, but not necessarily endospores, from inanimate objects or surfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Decontamination Decontamination is the treatment of an object or inanimate surface to make it safe to handle.\n",

      "\n",
      "5\n",
      "\n",
      ". Antiseptic  An antiseptic is an agent that kills or inhibits growth of microbes but is safe to use on human tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Sanitizer A sanitizer is an agent that reduces, but may not eliminate, microbial numbers to a safe level.\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",

      "\n",
      "B. TEMPERATURE\n",
      "\n",
      "Microorganisms have a minimum, an optimum, and a maximum temperature for growth. Temperatures below the minimum usually have a static action on microorganisms. They inhibit microbial growth by slowing down metabolism but do not necessarily kill the organism. Temperatures above the maximum usually have a cidal action, since they denature microbial enzymes and other proteins. Temperature is a very common and effective way of controlling microorganisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. High Temperature\n",
      "\n",
      "Vegetative microorganisms can generally be killed at temperatures from 50°C to 70°C with moist heat. Bacterial endospores, however, are very resistant to heat and extended exposure to much higher temperature is necessary for their destruction. High temperature may be applied as either moist heat or dry heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Moist heat\n",
      "\n",
      "Moist heat is generally more effective than dry heat for killing microorganisms because of its ability to penetrate microbial cells. Moist heat kills microorganisms by denaturing their proteins (causes proteins and enzymes to lose their three-dimensional functional shape). It also may melt lipids in cytoplasmic membranes.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Autoclaving\n",
      "\n",
      "Autoclaving employs steam under pressure. Water normally boils at 100°C; however, when put under pressure, water boils at a higher temperature. During autoclaving, the materials to be sterilized are placed under 15 pounds per square inch of pressure in a pressure-cooker type of apparatus. When placed under 15 pounds of pressure, the boiling point of water is raised to 121°C, a temperature sufficient to kill bacterial endospores.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time the material is left in the autoclave varies with the nature and amount of material being sterilized. Given sufficient time (generally 15-45 minutes), autoclaving is cidal for both vegetative organisms and endospores, and is the most common method of sterilization for materials not damaged by heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Boiling water\n",
      "\n",
      "Boiling water (100°C) will generally kill vegetative cells after about 10 minutes of exposure. However, certain viruses, such as the hepatitis viruses, may survive exposure to boiling water for up to 30 minutes, and endospores of certain Clostridium and Bacillus species may survive even hours of boiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Dry heat\n",
      "\n",
      "Dry heat kills microorganisms through a process of protein oxidation rather than protein coagulation. Examples of dry heat include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Hot air sterilization\n",
      "\n",
      "Microbiological ovens employ very high dry temperatures: 171°C for 1 hour; 160°C for 2 hours or longer; or 121°C for 16 hours or longer depending on the volume. They are generally used only for sterilizing glassware, metal instruments, and other inert materials like oils and powders that are not damaged by excessive temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Incineration\n",
      "\n",
      "Incinerators are used to destroy disposable or expendable materials by burning. We also sterilize our inoculating loops by incineration.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Pasteurization\n",
      "\n",
      "Pasteurization is the mild heating of milk and other materials to kill particular spoilage organisms or pathogens. It does not, however, kill all organisms. Milk is usually pasteurized by heating to 71°C for at least 15 seconds in the flash method or 63-66°C for 30 minutes in the holding method.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Low Temperature\n",
      "\n",
      "Low temperature inhibits microbial growth by slowing down microbial metabolism. Examples include refrigeration and freezing. Refrigeration at 5°C slows the growth of microorganisms and keeps food fresh for a few days. Freezing at -10°C stops microbial growth, but generally does not kill microorganisms, and keeps food fresh for several months.\n",

      "C. DESICCATION\n",
      "\n",
      "Desiccation, or drying, generally has a static effect on microorganisms. Lack of water inhibits the action of microbial enzymes. Dehydrated and freeze-dried foods, for example, do not require refrigeration because the absence of water inhibits microbial growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "D. OSMOTIC PRESSURE\n",
      "\n",
      "Microorganisms, in their natural environments, are constantly faced with alterations in osmotic pressure. Water tends to flow through semipermeable membranes, such as the cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms, towards the side with a higher concentration of dissolved materials (solute). In other words, water moves from greater water (lower solute) concentration to lesser water (greater solute) concentration.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the concentration of dissolved materials or solute is higher inside the cell than it is outside, the cell is said to be in a hypotonic environment and water will flow into the cell (Fig. 1 (http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/labmanua/lab18/u1fig5c.html)). The rigid cell walls of bacteria and fungi, however, prevent bursting or plasmoptysis. If the concentration of solute is the same both inside and outside the cell, the cell is said to be in an isotonic environment (Fig. 2 (http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/labmanua/lab18/u1fig5a.html)). Water flows equally in and out of the cell. Hypotonic and isotonic environments are not usually harmful to microorganisms. However, if the concentration of dissolved materials or solute is higher outside of the cell than inside, then the cell is in a hypertonic environment (Fig. 3 (http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/labmanua/lab18/u1fig5b.html)). Under this condition, water flows out of the cell, resulting in shrinkage of the cytoplasmic membrane or plasmolysis. Under such conditions, the cell becomes dehydrated and its growth is inhibited.\n",

Molds, on the other hand, are more tolerant of hypertonicity. Foods, such as those mentioned above, tend to become overgrown with molds unless they are first sealed to exclude oxygen.

      "E. RADIATION\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ultraviolet Radiation\n",
      "\n",
      "The ultraviolet portion of the light spectrum includes all radiations with wavelengths from 100 nm to 400 nm. It has low wave-length and low energy. The microbicidal activity of ultraviolet (UV) light depends on the length of exposure: the longer the exposure the greater the cidal activity. It also depends on the wavelength of UV used. The most cidal wavelengths of UV light lie in the 260 nm - 270 nm range where it is absorbed by nucleic acid.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of its mode of action, UV light is absorbed by microbial DNA and causes adjacent thymine bases on the same DNA strand to covalently bond together, forming what are called thymine-thymine dimers (see Fig. 4) (http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/labmanua/lab18/uv.html). As the DNA replicates, nucleotides do not complementary base pair with the thymine dimers and this terminates the replication of that DNA strand. However, most of the damage from UV radiation actually comes from the cell trying to repair the damage to the DNA by a process called SOS repair. In very heavily damaged DNA containing large numbers of thymine dimers, a process called SOS repair is activated as kind of a last ditch effort to repair the DNA. In this process, a gene product of the SOS system binds to DNA polymerase allowing it to synthesize new DNA across the damaged DNA. However, this altered DNA polymerase loses its proofreading ability resulting in the synthesis of DNA that itself now contains many misincorporated bases. In other words, UV radiation causes mutation and can lead to faulty protein synthesis. With sufficient mutation, bacterial metabolism is blocked and the organism dies. Agents such as UV radiation that cause high rates of mutation are called mutagens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effect of this inproper base pairing may be reversed to some extent by exposing the bacteria to strong visible light immediately after exposure to the UV light. The visible light activates an enzyme that breaks the bond that joins the thymine bases, thus enabling correct complementary base pairing to again take place. This process is called photoreactivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "UV lights are frequently used to reduce the microbial populations in hospital operating rooms and sinks, aseptic filling rooms of pharmaceutical companies, in microbiological hoods, and in the processing equipment used by the food and dairy industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "An important consideration when using UV light is that it has very poor penetrating power. Only microorganisms on the surface of a material that are exposed directly to the radiation are susceptible to destruction. UV light can also damage the eyes, cause burns, and cause mutation in cells of the skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Ionizing Radiation\n",
      "\n",
      "Ionizing radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays, has much more energy and penetrating power than ultraviolet radiation. It ionizes water and other molecules to form radicals (molecular fragments with unpaired electrons) that can disrupt DNA molecules and proteins. It is often used to sterilize pharmaceuticals and disposable medical supplies such as syringes, surgical gloves, catheters, sutures, and petri plates. It can also be used to retard spoilage in seafoods, meats, poultry, and fruits.\n",

      "Microbiological membrane filters provide a useful way of sterilizing materials such as vaccines, antibiotic solutions, animal sera, enzyme solutions, vitamin solutions, and other solutions that may be damaged or denatured by high temperatures or chemical agents. The filters contain pores small enough to prevent the passage of microbes but large enough to allow the organism-free fluid to pass through. The liquid is then collected in a sterile flask (Fig. 5) (http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/labmanua/lab18/millipore.html). Filters with a pore diameter from 25 nm to 0.45 µm are usually used in this procedure. Filters can also be used to remove microorganisms from water and air for microbiological testing (see Appendix E) (http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/labmanua/lab18/appe.html).\n",

      "Magnetic properties of materials are often utilized in advance technological devices such as superconductive Maglev trains, scanning electron microscopy, electron beam physical vapor deposition, and internal and external computer hard drives. There are five types of magnetism:\n",

      "diamagnetism,\n",

      "paramagnetism,\n",
      "\n",
      "ferromagnetism,\n",
      "\n",
      "antiferromagnetism, and\n",
      "\n",
      "ferrimagnetism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each type of magnetism differs from the others because of differences in the composition and crystal structures of the materials, and how electrons within these materials respond to a magnetic field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Ferrimagnetism can be thought of as a combination of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism (https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Materials_Science/Supplemental_Modules_(Materials_Science)/Magnetic_Properties/Antiferromagnetism) because of the many similarities between them, but it has important points of difference also. Similar to ferromagnets, ferrimagnets exhibit a spontaneous magnetic moment (i.e., a magnetic moment even in the absence of a magnetic field) and hysteresis below their Curie temperature, \\(T_c\\), and behave paramagnetically above the Curie temperature. On the other hand, similar to antiferromagnets, the magnetic moments of ferrimagnets align antiparallel to one another, the difference being that the net magnetic moment is non-zero. Ferrimagnetic materials are thus differentiated from ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials by the arrangement of their magnetic moments, and the dependence of the resulting magnetic properties on temperature, which depend on the types of elements in the material, its crystal structure, and microstructural processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ferrimagnetic materials are widely used in non-volatile memory devices such as hard drives, which utilize their ability to easily switch the spins of electrons and be magnetized. When a ferrimagnet inside a coil of conducting wire is rotate, current is generated, so they are also widely used in power motors and generators. Because ferrimagnets are electrically insulating, they are also widely used in high-frequency devices because no eddy currents are induced under AC fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ferrimagnetic Materials\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike ferromagnetic materials, which are typically metals, ferrimagnetic materials are ceramics, in particular, ceramic oxides. The most widely used ferrimagnets in technological devices are materials known as ferrites. Ferrites are electrically insulating  transitional-metal oxides with the general chemical formula MO·Fe2·O3, where M is a divalent ion such as Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, or Ni2+.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ferrites are often prepared by standard ceramic processing techniques. In the case of NiO.Fe2·O3 powders of NiO and Fe2O3 are mixed together and pressed into the desired shape before sintering (firing) at high temperature to form a dense ceramic of the desired composition. This method provides a reliable way of forming a wide variety of shapes and sizes of ferrimagnetic materials for embedding into technological devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Magnetization of Ferrimagnetic Materials\n",
      "\n",
      "Ferrimagnetic materials contain magnetic moments aligned antiparallel to one another, as illustrated in the figure below, similar to antiferromagnetic materials. However, instead of having a zero net magnetic moment, different numbers of unpaired electrons in the component transition metals result do not cancel one another out, resulting in a spontaneous magnetization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure below shows the ordering of magnetic ions in a ferrimagnetic lattice, with arrows pointing down being longer than those pointing up to indicate the relative size of the spin-up and spin-down moments. The result is a net magnetic moment in the down spin direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1: Magnetic ordering in a ferrimagnetic material.\n",
      "\n",
      "The antiparallel magnetic moments in both ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials can be explained by the superexchange behavior that occurs in oxide materials. Using manganese oxide, MnO, as an example, in its crystal oxygen ions, O2-, sit between manganese ions, Mn2+, as shown schematically in the figure below. Due to the different energy levels of the Mn and O orbitals, in order for bonding between the two ions to occur, the spin direction of one electron in Mn2+ is flipped to match that of the electron in the oxygen ion, thus forcing magnetic moments on either side of the molecule to be antiparallel to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 2: Initial transition of superexchange behavior in MnO where the magnetic moment of one electron of the left-side Mn3+ is flipped due to the down-spin of the electron in the leftmost orbital of the O2- ion to which it bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 3: The result of superexchange behavior whereby all electrons of the left-side Mn3+ are rotated to be antiparallel to the right-side Mn3+, so that both match the spins of the bonding orbitals of the O2- ion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spontaneous magnetization of ferrimagnetic materials originates from the non-zero net magnetic moments when filling up the d orbitals of transition metal ions according to Hund’s Rule. In the case of ferrites, which have what is known as an inverse spinel structure, the crystal structure can be thought of as consisting of two sublattices. Ions on sublattice A are tetrahedrally coordinated to neighboring oxide ions, while those on sublattice B are octahedrally coordinated (figure 4). Ions on each sublattice have their spins aligned in the same direction as one another. The magnetic moments of Fe3+ ions cancel each other out because there is the same number of ions on the A and B sublattices, but with their moments aligned in opposite directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order for there to be magnetization in the material, the numbers of magnetic ions on each of the sublattices have to be different, so that not all magnetic moments are canceled out. Specifically, in order to create features of ferrimagnetism from A Site and B Site, interactions involving both sublattices must be considered: A-A, B-B, and A-B site interactions. Since A sites and B sites in the inverse spinel structure have different environments, the magnetization and the Weiss molecular fields are also not identical in magnitude.  The total magnetization of the crystal can be expressed as the sum of magnetization on the A and B sublattices:\n",

      "An example of ferrimagnetic material is nickel ferrite, NiO·Fe2O3. The Fe3+ ions are evenly distributed across both A and B sublattices, and thus their magnetic moments cancel out, while Ni2+ ions sit on B sites only. The electron configuration of nickel is 3d84s2 (Figure 5), from which two electrons are taken from 4s2  to form Ni2+, giving an electron configuration of 3d8. The electron spins of the ion are arranged according to Hund’s Rule. First, all five states are filled with one spin-up electron, leaving three electrons with down spin to be added. Adding these electrons in accordance to Hund’s rule results in two unpaired spin-up electrons. These two unpaired electrons produce a net magnetic moment on Ni2+ ions; since these all sit on the same sublattice they are parallel and produce a net magnetic moment in the crystal.\n",

Before the Curie temperature, the saturation magnetization of a ferrimagnetic material decreases with increasing termpature until it vanishes completely at the Curie temperature, as illustrated in Figure 7. Above the Curie temperature, there is a 1/χ relationship with temperature, which also indicates a further decrease in magnetization.\n",

      "The major similarity between ferri- and antiferromagnetism is that they both experience superexchange behavior between ions that causes their magnetic moments to be antiparallel. The major difference between the two is that the net magnetic moment of the former is non-zero while in the latter it is zero. Antiferromagnetic materials thus do not exhibit spontaneous magnetization, while ferrimagnetic materials do.\n",

      "Fe2O3 consists of Fe3+ and O2- and has a net magnetic moment of zero. FeO consists of Fe2+ and O2- ions; taking two electrons from the 4s orbital of Fe leaves Fe2+ with 6 electrons in its 3d orbital, and, according to Hund's rule, each Fe2+ ion will have 4 unpaired electrons (in its high-spin state).\n",

      "Fructose is converted into glycogen in the liver and then follows the same pathway as glycogen to enter glycolysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sucrose is broken down into glucose and fructose; glucose enters the pathway directly while fructose is converted to glycogen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Terms\n",
      "\n",
      "disaccharide: A sugar, such as sucrose, maltose, or lactose, consisting of two monosaccharides combined together.\n",
      "\n",
      "glycogen: A polysaccharide that is the main form of carbohydrate storage in animals; converted to glucose as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "monosaccharide: A simple sugar such as glucose, fructose, or deoxyribose that has a single ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have learned about the catabolism of glucose, which provides energy to living cells. But living things consume more than glucose for food. How does a turkey sandwich end up as ATP in your cells? This happens because all of the catabolic pathways for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids eventually connect into glycolysis and the citric acid cycle pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Metabolic pathways should be thought of as porous; that is, substances enter from other pathways, and intermediates leave for other pathways. These pathways are not closed systems. Many of the substrates, intermediates, and products in a particular pathway are reactants in other pathways. Like sugars and amino acids, the catabolic pathways of lipids are also connected to the glucose catabolism pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glycogen Pathway: Glycogen from the liver and muscles, hydrolyzed into glucose-1-phosphate, together with fats and proteins, can feed into the catabolic pathways for carbohydrates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glycogen, a polymer of glucose, is an energy-storage molecule in animals. When there is adequate ATP present, excess glucose is shunted into glycogen for storage. Glycogen is made and stored in both the liver and muscles. The glycogen is hydrolyzed into the glucose monomer, glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P), if blood sugar levels drop. The presence of glycogen as a source of glucose allows ATP to be produced for a longer period of time during exercise. Glycogen is broken down into G-1-P and converted into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in both muscle and liver cells; this product enters the glycolytic pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glycogen Structure: Schematic two-dimensional cross-sectional view of glycogen: A core protein of glycogenin is surrounded by branches of glucose units. The entire globular granule may contain around 30,000 glucose units.\n",
      "\n",
      "Galactose is the sugar in milk. Infants have an enzyme in the small intestine that metabolizes lactose to galactose and glucose. In areas where milk products are regularly consumed, adults have also evolved this enzyme. Galactose is converted in the liver to G-6-P and can thus enter the glycolytic pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fructose is one of the three dietary monosaccharides (along with glucose and galactose) which are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. Fructose is absorbed from the small intestine and then passes to the liver to be metabolized, primarily to glycogen. The catabolism of both fructose and galactose produces the same number of ATP molecules as glucose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fructose Metabolism: Although the metabolism of fructose and glucose share many of the same intermediate structures, they have very different metabolic fates in human metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sucrose is a disaccharide with a molecule of glucose and a molecule of fructose bonded together with a glycosidic linkage. The catabolism of sucrose breaks it down to monomers of glucose and fructose. The glucose can directly enter the glycolytic pathway while fructose must first be converted to glycogen, which can be broken down to G-1-P and enter the glycolytic pathway as described above.\n",

If the baby has lost consciousness, Call the emergency services. Position the baby on their back First Aid Techniques: Infant breathing normally? Check for breathing by placing one hand on the baby’s forehead and the fingers of the other under their chin Tilt the head into the NEUTRAL position to open the airways If you see no chest movement, hear no breath sounds and do not feel their breath on your cheek, the baby is not breathing 2 - Alert emergency services Alert the emergency services 3- Defibrillator If you have access to a defibrillator near to you, go and fetch it, or otherwise ask somebody else present to look for it 4 - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation If there is no defibrillator or while waiting for one, start cardiopulmonary resuscitation To do this, Place two fingers in the middle of the baby’s chest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation 30 chest compressions Perform 30 chest compressions, pressing down to a third of the depth of the chest maintain a rate of 2 compressions per second 2 Rescue Breaths Alternate cycles of 30 compressions with 2 rescue breaths, if you know how to give mouth-to-mouth breathing. Or Chest Compressions If not, do chest compressions only. If you give rescue breaths, put the baby’s head in the neutral position before doing so, place your mouth over the baby’s nose and mouth and check that the chest inflates. Continue CPR without stopping until the infant begins to breathe normally, medical help arrives or a defibrillator is ready to use Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in infants In the first few minutes after cardiac arrest, the victim may breathe weakly or take occasional gasps. These are known as gasps and should not be confused with normal breathing.\n",

      "The floating-point data type is a family of data types that act alike and differ only in the size of their domains (the allowable values). The floating-point family of data types represent number values with fractional parts. They are technically stored as two integer values: a mantissa and an exponent. The floating-point family has the same attributes and acts or behaves similarly in all programming languages. They can always store negative or positive values thus they always are signed; unlike the integer data type that could be unsigned. The domain for floating-point data types varies because they could represent very large numbers or very small numbers. Rather than talk about the actual values, we mention the precision. The more bytes of storage the larger the mantissa and exponent, thus more precision.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most often used floating-point family data type used in C++ is the double. By default, most compilers convert floating-point constants into the double data type for use in calculations. The double data type will store just about any number most beginning programmers will ever encounter.\n",

      "I Am Latvia\n",
      "\n",
      "The author’s approach to this report is fresh and original; speaking as the country makes the paper very readable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I Am Latvia\n",
      "\n",
      "In the beginning, my people were primitive, and they used my resources to survive. They used stone, and then bronze and iron for tools. They traded with other peoples from afar, beyond my reaches. They became clever and prosperous; they built permanent homes for themselves. I was happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am beautiful. I stretch from the Baltic Sea to the southern Daugava River, and the lands within are rich. Or, at least, they once were . . . before the invaders came. But my lands had contained riches, of dolomite and lumber, and most of all, of amber. Amber, the ancient tree sap that had turned to rock over time, had become more precious than gold. My people traded amber gathered along my coasts to places around the vast world, and became very rich. They farmed the land and grew grain and flax. Their meals were simple but wholesome. Some special foods were kisels, eaten only on holidays, and putras, a porridge of barley and oats. Their lives were simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the first invaders came. They called themselves the Teutonic Knights, or Knights of the Sword. They attacked my people, destroying whole towns! Our warriors tried to fight but were slaughtered by the advanced weapons of our conquerors. Soon, they had taken away my lands, and they began to convert my people to a new religion called Catholicism. One of the knights founded Riga, my capital city, and the jewel of my land. Unfortunately, my people were horribly oppressed under the harsh Teutonic rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so it continued. The Teutonics were overthrown by the Polish, the Polish were overthrown by the Lithuanians, the Lithuanians were overthrown by the Russians. My people were always second-class citizens, never independent, never given their own identity. And yet, in some places, the old ways remained, and my people held on. The “St. Petersburg Paper” was published in Riga from 1862-1865. It created some of the earliest feelings of nationalism among my people. Its main editors were Krisjanis Barons and Krisjanis Valdemars. Written only a little later, in 1873, was the Latvian National Anthem (considered so 50 years before Latvia would become a country), “Dievs Svcti Latviyu,” or “God Bless Latvia.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Time passed. The Germans captured my country next and made my people into slaves. Then, once again, it was the Russians! I wondered if it would ever end. But I had been in existence for a long time, and I was patient. Finally, after nearly 900 years since my people had been independent at all, a Great War broke out throughout the land. The Russians, who were the rulers, had a revolution, and lost their hold on my people in 1918. We became independent! I was so proud of them. A president was elected, and my people recovered, multiplied, and prospered once more. Later, the government of my people became corrupt. A man named Karlis Ulmanis declared a state of emergency and took it over. He was a dictator, but a benevolent one, and he saved the government from collapse. My country began to become one of the richest in the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "But disaster struck again. Another Great War began, and we were attacked by the Russians. Our armies, despite being untrained, fought better than they did, but still they outnumbered us. They pushed my people back until the only ones still fighting were trapped in a castle in the center of Riga. Then they, too, fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Russians had a new form of government called Communism. They took away all the farms and made them into huge, collectivized impersonal farms, where my people slaved away to live. Then the Germans and the Russians fought, with both sides burning my fields and killing my people. We were caught in the middle, and we couldn’t get out. In the end, the Russians “won” control over us. They polluted my air, land, and water with foul toxins in the name of “industrialization.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we were ruled, for nearly another 50 years. My people wanted independence, for, beyond the bad treatment of their land, the Russians had no similar culture. Not even their language or alphabet was the same! My people use a Roman alphabet, and the Russians use Cyrillic. My people speak Lettish, a language totally different than Russian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then things finally began to change. The Russian government began to weaken. My people, allied with people of the neighboring lands of Estonia and Lithuania, spoke out against the Russians. Protesters formed a human chain across the three countries. The Freedom Movement in Riga, a giant statue of a person holding three five-pointed stars, was sculpted by Elmars Rudzitis at this time. When the Russian government collapsed, we were officially granted independence! The new government was a democracy. The president and Prime Minister were elected, and so was the 100-seat Saeima, or parliament. Many political parties sprang up.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was much to recover from, but my people still had their culture and their heritage. Without the supplies that the Russians had made my people dependent on, there was less money and fewer jobs. And cleaning up the pollution was a huge job. But my people struggled through it. Slowly the economy began to improve, and my people began to manufacture goods to be sent to other lands. Some of the old way of life resumed when the farms were de-collectivized, and freedom grew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many aspects of my people’s culture live on. The dainas, which were sacred four-line poems/songs, are still known today. My people are very fond of singing. Since 1876, they have held the Latvian Song Festival, where thousands of people go to sing and dance. It has gone on every five years since then. Folk dances are very popular, too. Many of my people still wear the national costume, which is a traditional suit for men, and a brightly woven skirt over a white blouse for women. Women also sometimes wear glittery golden headbands. Traditional instruments that are played are the stringed kokle, the reed stabule, and the percussion trejdeksnis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much song and dance goes on during the holidays. During Ziemas Zvetki, or Winter Holiday, everyone sings of the sun soon to be returning to warm my lands. Though I exist far to the north, the Atlantic Current flows into the Baltic Sea and keeps me warm. Jani, or St. John’s Day, is a holiday where people sing and chant all night to ward off evil spirits. Men and women wear wreaths of wildflowers, and this holiday brings together the ancient Earth-worshipping beliefs and the newer Christian ones. During the Russian occupation, my people were often not allowed to practice any religions, and nearly all my people who were Jewish were killed when the Germans came through. Now, though, many religions are flourishing, and religious tolerance is practiced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Coat of Arms is a symbol of myself and my people. On it are a red lion that symbolizes the southern half of my lands, and a white griffin that symbolizes the northern half. A ribbon ties the two halves together. In the last millenium, my people had only been independent for 40 total years. But this time, they were going to hold on to their freedom and national pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, I sit back and watch them. I am proud of my people, they have accomplished much in the face of terrible odds. They are a beautiful people in a beautiful land. I have seen them. And I remember.\n",

      "Electric flux density, assigned the symbol \\({\\bf D}\\), is an alternative to electric field intensity (\\({\\bf E}\\)) as a way to quantify an electric field. This alternative description offers some actionable insight, as we shall point out at the end of this section.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, what is electric flux density? Recall that a particle having charge \\(q\\) gives rise to the electric field intensity\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[{\\bf E} = \\hat{\\bf R} ~ q ~ \\frac{1}{4\\pi R^2} ~ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\label{m0011_eEparticle1}\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "where \\(R\\) is distance from the charge and \\(\\hat{\\bf R}\\) points away from the charge. Note that \\({\\bf E}\\) is inversely proportional to \\(4\\pi R^2\\), indicating that \\({\\bf E}\\) decreases in proportion to the area of a sphere surrounding the charge. Now integrate both sides of Equation \\ref{m0011_eEparticle1} over a sphere \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) of radius \\(R\\):\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\\oint_{\\mathcal{S}} {\\bf E}({\\bf r}) \\cdot d{\\bf s} = \\oint_{\\mathcal{S}} \\left[ \\hat{\\bf R} ~ q ~ \\frac{1}{4\\pi R^2} ~ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\right] \\cdot d{\\bf s}\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Factoring out constants that do not vary with the variables of integration, the right-hand side becomes:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[q ~ \\frac{1}{4\\pi R^2} ~ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} ~ \\oint_{\\mathcal{S}} \\hat{\\bf R} \\cdot d{\\bf s} \\nonumber\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that \\(d{\\bf s}=\\hat{\\bf R}ds\\) in this case, and also that \\(\\hat{\\bf R}\\cdot\\hat{\\bf R}=1\\). Thus, the right-hand side simplifies to:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[q ~ \\frac{1}{4\\pi R^2} ~ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} ~ \\oint_{\\mathcal{S}} ~ds \\nonumber\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining integral is simply the area of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), which is \\(4\\pi R^2\\). Thus, we find:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\\oint_{\\mathcal{S}} {\\bf E}({\\bf r}) \\cdot d{\\bf s} = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon} \\label{m0011_eEparticle2}\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "The integral of a vector field over a specified surface is known as flux (see “Additional Reading” at the end of this section). Thus, we have found that the flux of \\({\\bf E}\\) through the sphere \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is equal to a constant, namely \\(q/\\epsilon\\). Furthermore, this constant is the same regardless of the radius \\(R\\) of the sphere. Said differently, the flux of \\({\\bf E}\\) is constant with distance, and does not vary as \\({\\bf E}\\) itself does. Let us capitalize on this observation by making the following small modification to Equation \\ref{m0011_eEparticle2}:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\\oint_{\\mathcal{S}} \\left[\\epsilon {\\bf E}\\right] \\cdot d{\\bf s} = q\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, the flux of the quantity \\(\\epsilon {\\bf E}\\) is equal to the enclosed charge, regardless of the radius of the sphere over which we are doing the calculation. This leads to the following definition:\n",
      "\n",
      "electric flux density\n",
      "\n",
      "The electric flux density \\({\\bf D} = \\epsilon {\\bf E}\\), having units of C/m\\(^2\\), is a description of the electric field in terms of flux, as opposed to force or change in electric potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may appear that \\({\\bf D}\\) is redundant information given \\({\\bf E}\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\), but this is true only in homogeneous media. The concept of electric flux density becomes important – and decidedly not redundant – when we encounter boundaries between media having different permittivities. As we shall see in Section 5.18, boundary conditions on \\({\\bf D}\\) constrain the component of the electric field that is perpendicular to the boundary separating two regions. If one ignores the “flux” character of the electric field represented by \\({\\bf D}\\) and instead considers only \\({\\bf E}\\), then only the tangential component of the electric field is constrained. In fact, when one of the two materials comprising the boundary between two material regions is a perfect conductor, then the electric field is completely determined by the boundary condition on \\({\\bf D}\\). This greatly simplifies the problem of finding the electric field in a region bounded or partially bounded by materials that can be modeled as perfect conductors, including many metals. In particular, this principle makes it easy to analyze capacitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "We conclude this section with a warning. Even though the SI units for \\({\\bf D}\\) are C/m\\(^2\\), \\({\\bf D}\\) describes an electric field and not a surface charge density. It is certainly true that one may describe the amount of charge distributed over a surface using units of C/m\\(^2\\). However, \\({\\bf D}\\) is not necessarily a description of actual charge, and there is no implication that the source of the electric field is a distribution of surface charge. On the other hand, it is true that \\({\\bf D}\\) can be interpreted as an equivalent surface charge density that would give rise to the observed electric field, and in some cases, this equivalent charge density turns out to be the actual charge density.\n",

      "I refer here to pincushion or barrel distortion introduced by the optical system. This results in a displacement of the stellar images towards or away from the plate centre. Unlike differential refraction or aberration of light, the stellar displacements are symmetric with respect to inversion through the plate centre. This is also true of the optical aberration known as coma. A comatic stellar image results in a displacement of the centre of the stellar image away from the plate centre. Thus we can deal with distortion and coma in a similar manner.\n",

      "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the most common type of noninvasive breast cancer and comprises 25% of breast cancers diagnosed in the US. As with invasive breast cancer, the risk of DCIS increases with age and is uncommon in women younger than 30. Eighty percent of cases are diagnosed by mammography due to the presence of microcalficiations; very few cases can be palpated as masses on physical examination. Diagnosis is confirmed by a core or excisional biopsy of the lesion. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is insufficient to differentiate DCIS from invasive disease. Histologic characteristics include neoplastic proliferation with malignant features but without invasion of the basement membrane. DCIS carries an excellent prognosis, with the risk of cancer-related death about 1.9% within ten years.\n",

After learning that she had a significant family history of breast cancer on her mother's side, she decided to get a bilateral mastectomy in order to reduce her risk of breast cancer.\n",

      "In silicon technology it is common to refer to the first capacitor type as a metal-oxide-metal (MOM) capacitor or as a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor. A MOM capacitor can be realized as a parallel plate capacitance (see Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)(a)), and multiple levels of metalization can be used to increase the capacitance density. Relatively low capacitance values of up to \\(500\\text{ fF/}\\mu\\text{m}^{2}\\) are typically available.\n",

      "An alternative MOM capacitance is available using lateral arrangements of conductors on the same layer (see Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)(b)); that is, adjacent metal structures are separated by a small horizontal gap. Again, there are two distinct metal connections, and a smaller metal separation can be obtained using photolithography than that possible using dielectric separation. However the capacitance density is only increased by a factor of about three. Higher values can be obtained using the interdigitated capacitor (IDC) of Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)(c). Both types of MOM capacitance, parallel plate and lateral, are geometrically defined, are voltage independent, have very low temperature coefficients, and have initial fabrication tolerances of \\(20\\%–30\\%\\).\n",

      "The second type of capacitor in MOS technology is referred to as a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor. MOS capacitors use a MOS transistor with a parallel-plate capacitance between the gate of a MOS transistor and a heavily inverted channel. The drain and source are connected in this configuration and the separation between the conductors is thin, being the gate oxide thickness. This leads to high values of capacitance, although with a weak voltage dependence. Junction capacitance is realized as the capacitance of a reverse-biased semiconductor junction. This capacitance can be quite large, but has a strong voltage dependence. This voltage dependence can be utilized to realize tunable circuits (e.g., a voltage-controlled oscillator).\n",

In addition to their role in matching networks, they are used to provide bias to active devices while effectively blocking RF signals from the bias circuitry. Inductors of up to \\(10\\text{ nH}\\) can be fabricated in compact form, with the spiral inductor of Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)(e) being typical. Bond wires can also be used to realize small inductances in the \\(0.5–1\\text{ nH}\\) range. One of the advantages of having a portion of a large inductance on-chip is reduced sensitivity to die attach (bondwire, etc.) connections used to connect to an external inductance. Small values of inductance can be realized by the meander line inductor of Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)(d). This is based on a high-impedance length of line (narrow line in microstrip) appearing inductive.\n",

This formula was derived for circular coils, but its accuracy for square spirals is within \\(5\\%\\) of values obtained using EM simulation [4]. It is therefore a very useful formula in the early stages of design, but EM analysis is required to obtain the necessary accuracy and frequency dependence of the inductor. Fields produced by a spiral inductor penetrate the substrate, and as the ground plane is located at a short distance away, the eddy currents on the ground plane reduce the inductance that would otherwise be obtained. The eddy current in the ground conductor rotates in a direction opposite to that of the current on the spiral itself. As a result, the flux of the image inductor in the ground is in the opposite direction to that produced by the spiral itself, with the consequent effect that the effective total inductance is reduced. By creating a broken conductor pattern, the ground inductance is largely eliminated as the eddy currents cannot flow [5].\n",

These induced currents follow a path under the conductors of the spiral and, just as with ground plane eddy currents, lowers the inductance achieved. However, the resistance of the lines is unchanged. Thus on silicon it is difficult to achieve very high \\(Q_{s}\\) (the ratio of stored energy to energy dissipated per cycle).\n",

      "Lumped inductors are based on coils of conductor, and there is parasitic capacitance between the windings [6]. As a result there will be a frequency where the capacitance and inductance resonate at what is called the self-resonant frequency. The impedance of a realistic inductor is shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)(c). If the practical inductor was purely inductive, then its impedance would increase linearly with frequency. However, because of resonance, the effective inductance increases just before resonance causing the impedance of the practical inductor to increase more rapidly than linearly. This is seen in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)(c), and this effect is often used in narrowband microwave circuits.\n",

      "Summary:  For a function to be continuous at a point, it must be defined at that point, its limit must exist at the point, and the value of the function at that point must equal the value of the limit at that point. Discontinuities may be classified as removable, jump, or infinite. A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. It is continuous over a closed interval if it is continuous at every point in its interior and is continuous at its endpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many functions have the property that their graphs can be traced with a pencil without lifting the pencil from the page. Such functions are called continuous. Other functions have points at which a break in the graph occurs, but satisfy this property over intervals contained in their domains. They are continuous on these intervals and are said to have a discontinuity at a point where a break occurs.\n",

      "وتم  تجربة زراعة هذه البذور فى قرية “كويزالتيك” Quezaltepeque، و التى تقع شمال مدينة  سان سلفادور بحوالى 30 كيلومترا،  وقد أعرب المزراعين عن سعادتهم لتطبيق أول أختبار للحبة في قريتهم.كما أظهروا بفخر حصاد وفير من حوالي 0.7 من الهكتار (1.7 فدان) من الفاصوليا تزرع في المزرعة التي يعملون فيها, كما يصفونها  بأنها نباتات “سحرية”.\n",

      "Cascade of events:  A transmembrane receptor OR a cytoplasmic protein  WITH LIGAND-DEPENDENT ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY (guanylate cyclase) binds an extracellular chemical signal (for the transmembrane receptor) or an intracellular ligand (for the cytoplasmic protein receptor), causing a conformational change in the receptor.  The bound receptor is now a guanylate cyclase which converts GTP into cyclic GMP. This second messenger, like cAMP which binds to and activates PKA,  binds to and activates thecGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG).  An example of a hormone which works through a transmembrane receptor is atrial naturetic factor, which binds to a cell-surface receptor whose shape change is communicated to the intracellular receptor domain through the single transmembrane helix, leading to the activation of the intracelluar guanylate cyclase domain of the protein.   Likewise, nitric oxide, NO, a gaseous ligand formed from Arg, can diffuse through the cell membrane, where it binds to the heme of a cytoplasmic receptor/guanylate cyclase which form cGMP, leading to activation of PKG. (Steroid hormones also enter the cell where they interact with a cytoplasmic receptor which often acts as steroid hormone-dependent transcription factor. )\n",

      "Respiration can occur using a variety of respiratory organs in different animals, including skin, gills, and tracheal systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n",
      "\n",
      "Describe how the skin, gills, and tracheal system are used in the process of respiration\n",
      "\n",
      "KEY TAKEAWAYS\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Points\n",
      "\n",
      "Some animals, such as amphibians and earthworms, can use their skin (integument) to exchange gases between the external environment and the circulatory system due to the network of capillaries that lie below the skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fish and other aquatic organisms use gills to take up oxygen dissolved in the water and diffuse carbon dioxide out of the bloodstream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some insects utilize a tracheal system that transports oxygen from the external environment through openings called spiracles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Terms\n",
      "\n",
      "coelom: a fluid-filled cavity within the body of an animal; the digestive system is suspended within the cavity, which is lined by a tissue called the peritoneum\n",
      "\n",
      "gill: a breathing organ of fish and other aquatic animals\n",
      "\n",
      "spiracle: a pore or opening used (especially by spiders and some fish) for breathing\n",
      "\n",
      "Skin and Gills\n",
      "\n",
      "There are various methods of gas exchange used by animals. As seen in mammals, air is taken in from the external environment to the lungs. Other animals, such as earthworms and amphibians, use their skin (integument) as a respiratory organ. A dense network of capillaries lies just below the skin, facilitating gas exchange between the external environment and the circulatory system. The respiratory surface must be kept moist in order for the gases to dissolve and diffuse across cell membranes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Organisms that live in water also need a way to obtain oxygen. Oxygen dissolves in water, but at a lower concentration in comparison to the atmosphere, which has roughly 21 percent oxygen. Fish and many other aquatic organisms have evolved gills to take up the dissolved oxygen from water. Gills are thin tissue filaments that are highly branched and folded. When water passes over the gills, the dissolved oxygen in the water rapidly diffuses across the gills into the bloodstream. The circulatory system can then carry the oxygenated blood to the other parts of the body. In animals that contain coelomic fluid instead of blood, oxygen diffuses across the gill surfaces into the coelomic fluid. Gills are found in mollusks, annelids, and crustaceans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common carp: This common carp, like many other aquatic organisms, has gills that allow it to obtain oxygen from water.\n",
      "\n",
      "The folded surfaces of the gills provide a large surface area to ensure that fish obtain sufficient oxygen. Diffusion is a process in which material travels from regions of high concentration to low concentration until equilibrium is reached. In this case, blood with a low concentration of oxygen molecules circulates through the gills. The concentration of oxygen molecules in water is higher than the concentration of oxygen molecules in gills. As a result, oxygen molecules diffuse from water (high concentration) to blood (low concentration). Similarly, carbon dioxide molecules diffuse from the blood (high concentration) to water (low concentration).\n",
      "\n",
      "Oxygen transport and gills: As water flows over the gills, oxygen is transferred to blood via the veins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tracheal Systems\n",
      "\n",
      "Insect respiration is independent of its circulatory system; therefore, the blood does not play a direct role in oxygen transport. Insects have a highly-specialized type of respiratory system called the tracheal system, which consists of a network of small tubes that carries oxygen to the entire body. The tracheal system, the most direct and efficient respiratory system in active animals, has tubes made of a polymeric material called chitin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insect bodies have openings, called spiracles, along the thorax and abdomen. These openings connect to the tubular network, allowing oxygen to pass into the body, regulating the diffusion of CO2 and water vapor. Air enters and leaves the tracheal system through the spiracles. Some insects can ventilate the tracheal system with body movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insect respiration: Insects perform respiration via a tracheal system, in which openings called spiracles allow oxygen to pass into the body.\n",

      "Name given members of a family of closely-related chemicals. The term dioxin is often used for one of these: 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin or TCDD. This substance was present as a contaminant in the herbicide agent orange, which was so widely used during the Vietnam war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 12.13.1: Structure of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.\n",
      "\n",
      "When ingested or injected, TCDD is extremely poisonous to laboratory animals. At sub-lethal concentrations, it causes cancer and birth defects in them. Exposure to high levels of dioxins causes a severe skin disease (chloracne) in humans as well as damage to the liver and nervous system. While the evidence is still hotly debated, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is convinced that dioxins cause cancer in humans. They base this conclusion on extrapolating from dose-response studies done in animals (rats) and following the health of industrial workers who were exposed to dioxins in the U.S., Germany, and the Netherlands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the development of delicate analytical techniques, it is possible to detect trace amounts in everyone's blood. Most of us have a few parts per trillion (ppt) of TCDD in our serum. TCDD (and other dioxins) are produced when organic matter is burned. Measurable levels are found in soot from wood-burning stoves and the ash of municipal incinerators. However, the amounts to which we are exposed have dropped some threefold since the mid-80s, and the cancer risk dioxins pose for most of us is probably close to zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dioxin can prevent disease! (in mice). Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a disease in experimental animals (e.g., mice, guinea pigs) that closely mimics multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease of humans in which the myelin sheaths of neurons are destroyed. In the 1 May 2008 issue of Nature, F. J. Quintana and colleagues reported that they could strongly suppress the induction of EAE in mice by pretreating them with 1 µg of TCDD. The protection appeared to be mediated by regulatory T cells (Treg) whose numbers rose sharply following TCDD treatment.\n",

      "&nbsp; Welcome back. Now that we hopefully have a little bit of an intuition of what a limit is or finding the limit of a function is. Let's do some problems. Some of these you might see on your exams or when you're actually trying to solve a general limit problem. So let's say that, what is the limit? Once again, my pen is not working. What is the limit as x approaches? Let's say, -1, and let me see,what's a good? Let's say my expression is-- I'll put parenthesis so it's cleaner,say it's (2x + 2)/(x + 1). So the first thing I would always try to do is just say, well, what happens if I just stick x straight into this expression? What happens? Well, what's 2x + 2when x = -1? It's 2 times -1, (2 times -1 + 2)/(-1 + 1). Well, the numerator is -2 + 2, that equals 0, over, what's the denominator? (-1 + 1)/0. And do we know what 0/0 is? Well, well no, it's undefined, right? So here's a case, just like what we saw in that first video where the limit can't equal what the expression equals when you substitute x for the number you're trying to find the limit of because you get an undefined answer. So see if using the limit we can come up with a better answer for what it's approaching. Since we're just starting with these limit problems, let me draw a graph. I think this is gonna give you the intuition for what we're doing. And it'll probably give you the answer, but then I'll show you how to solve this analytically. So, if I draw a graph, so these are the axes. I'll do the graphical and the analytical at the same time. So, I'm gonna rewrite this expression in a way that maybe I can simplify it. So 2x + 2, isn't that the same thing as 2 times (x + 1)? 2 times (x + 1), right? 2x + 2 is the same thing as 2 times (x + 1), and then all of that is over, all of that is over x + 1, so as long as this expression and this expression don't equal 0, it actually turns out that this function, let's say that this is f(x), right? This function, well, for every value other than x = -1, you could actually cancel this and this out, and so really we see that f(x) is equal to-- I need to find a better tool-- f(x) = 2 when x does not equal -1. And we saw when x is equal to -1, it's undefined; so undefined, undefined. Undefined when x = -1. So how would we graph that? We saw that f(x) = 2 when x is not equal to -1, and f(x) is undefined when x = -1. And once again, all I did was kind of rewrite this exact same function, right? I showed that I could simplify and I could divide the numerator and denominator by x + 1 as long as x does not equal -1 and then otherwise, it's undefined. So let me graph this. And I'll get a different color,maybe I'll go with red. So this is 2, so we see that x is-- and then this is -1. So for every other valueother than -1, the value of this, of f(x) = 2. This is just, you know, this is 1, this is 2, this is 3--the pen stops, this is 3. So at -1 the graph is undefined, so there's a hole there, and that we keep going to the left-hand side. So if we're gonna do the limit, we can just visually say, well, as x--let me do another color now, as x comes from the left-hand side, as x goes from this side, what does f(x) equal? Well, f(x) is 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, f(x) = 2 until we get to exactly -1, right? And similarly, when we go from the other hand, it's the exact same thing. f(x) is 2, 2, 2, until we get to -1. So, you'll see, and make sure you see the visual here, that the limit as x approaches -1 of (2 x + 2)/(x + 1), it equals 2. Let me draw a line here so you don't get mixed up. And I'm not formally, I guess, proving here that the limit is 2, but I'm showing you an analytical way, and this is how it tends to be done in algebra class, is that you tend to simplify the expression so you say, if there wasn't a hole here, what would the f(x) equal? And then, you just evaluate it at that point. I think this might give you a little intuition, but this isn't a formal solution, unless you're asked to, you tend not to be asked for a formal solution, you're asked what the limit is, and this is the way you can solve it. Actually another way that you could-- I often used to check my answers when I used to do it is you could take a calculator and try in, you know, what happens when-- what is f(-1.001), right? And you could also try what is f(-.999), right? 'Cause what you wanna do is you wanna say, what is the function equal when I get really close to -1, and then you could keep going closer and closer to -1 and see what the function approaches, and in this case you'll see that it approaches 2. So let's do another problem. Well let's say what is the limit? My pen, something wrong there, what is the limit as x approaches 0 of 1/x ? I think here it might be useful to draw this graph 'cause it'll give you a visual representation. Actually, let's do it both ways. Let's do it the picking numbers method 'cause I think that'll give you an intuition, and maybe it'll help us draw the graph. So, let's say that this is f(x), let's say that f(x), f(x)--you can tell my presentation is very unplanned, f(x) = 1/x. And we wanna find the limit as x approaches 0. So what is f of-- actually let's make a table. f(x). So clearly when x = 0 we don't know, it's undefined, 1/0 is undefined. So we get undefined. Well, what happens when x = -.01? Well, when it's -.01, 1/-.01 that is equal to -100, right? What happens when x = -.001, right? So we're getting closer and closer to 0 from the negative direction. Well, here it equals-- gotta make sure my pen is working, color right, something's wrong with my tool. My computer is breaking down, I see what's going on. I think my computer just froze. Well, I'm gonna try to solve thisand in the very next video, I'm gonna continue onwith this problem. So, I'll see you at the next presentation while I figure out why my pen isn't working and then we'll continue with this problem. See you very soon.\n",

      "IPv4 has run out of large address blocks, as of 2011. IPv6 has reached a mature level of development. Most common operating systems provide excellent IPv6 support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet conversion has been slow. Many ISPs still provide limited (to nonexistent) support, and inexpensive IPv6 firewalls to replace the ubiquitous consumer-grade NAT routers are just beginning to appear. Time will tell how all this evolves. However, while IPv6 has now been around for twenty years, top-level IPv4 address blocks disappeared much more recently. It is quite possible that this will prove to be just the catalyst IPv6 needs.\n",

      "\n",
      "Exercises are given fractional (floating point) numbers, to allow for interpolation of new exercises.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.0. Each IPv6 address is associated with a specific solicited-node multicast address.\n",
      "\n",
      "(a). Explain why, on a typical Ethernet, if the original IPv6 host address was obtained via SLAAC then the LAN multicast group corresponding to the host’s solicited-node multicast addresses is likely to be small, in many cases consisting of one host only. (Packet delivery to small LAN multicast groups can be much more efficient than delivery to large multicast groups.)\n",
      "\n",
      "(b). What steps might a DHCPv6 server take to ensure that, for the IPv6 addresses it hands out, the LAN multicast groups corresponding to the host addresses’ solicited-node multicast addresses will be small?\n",
      "\n",
      "2.0. If an attacker sends a large number of probe packets via IPv4, you can block them by blocking the attacker’s IP address. Now suppose the attacker uses IPv6 to launch the probes; for each probe, the attacker changes the low-order 64 bits of the address. Can these probes be blocked efficiently? If so, what do you have to block? Might you also be blocking other users?\n",
      "\n",
      "3.0. Suppose someone tried to implement ping6 so that, if the address was a link-local address and no interface was specified, the ICMPv6 Echo Request was sent out all non-loopback interfaces. Could the end result be different than conventional ping6 with the correct interface supplied? If so, how likely is this?\n",
      "\n",
      "4.0. Create an IPv6 ssh connection as in 8.12   IPv6 Examples Without a Router (https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_Computer_Networks_(Dordal)/08%3A_IP_version_6#routerless-connection-examples). Examine the connection’s packets using WireShark or the equivalent. Does the TCP handshake (12.3   TCP Connection Establishment) look any different over IPv6?\n",
      "\n",
      "5.0. Create an IPv6 ssh connection using manually configured addresses as in 8.12.3   Manual address configuration (https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_Computer_Networks_(Dordal)/08%3A_IP_version_6#manual-address-configuration). Again use WireShark or the equivalent to monitor the connection. Is DAD (8.7.1   Duplicate Address Detection (https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_Computer_Networks_(Dordal)/08%3A_IP_version_6#dad)) used?\n",
      "\n",
      "6.0. An IPv6 fixed-header is 40 bytes. Taking this as the minimum packet size, how long will it take to send 1015 hosts (one quadrillion) probe packets to a site, if the bandwidth is 1 Gbps?\n",
      "\n",
      "7.0. Suppose host A gets its IPv6 traffic through tunnel provider H, as in 8.13   IPv6 Connectivity via Tunneling (https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_Computer_Networks_(Dordal)/08%3A_IP_version_6#in4). To improve security, A blocks all packets that are not part of connections it has initiated, and makes no exception for ICMPv6 traffic. H is correctly configured to know the MTU of the A–H link. For (a) and (b), this MTU is 1280, the minimum allowed for IPv6. Much of the Internet, however, allows larger MTU values.\n",
      "\n",
      "A ─── H ─── Internet ─── B\n",
      "\n",
      "(a). If A attempts to send a larger-than-1280-byte IPv6 packet to remote host B, will A be informed of the resultant failure? Why or why not?\n",
      "\n",
      "(b). Suppose B attempts to send a larger-than-1280-byte IPv6 packet to A. Will B receive an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big message? Why or why not?\n",
      "\n",
      "(c). Now suppose the MTU of the A–H link is raised to 1400 bytes. Outline a scenario in which A sends a packet of size greater than 1280 bytes to remote host B, the packet is too big to make it all the way to B, and yet A receives no notification of this.\n",

      "Nuclear energy is energy in the nucleus (core) of an atom (see chapter 1 for a review of atomic structure). There is enormous energy in the forces that hold protons and neutrons in the nucleus together. Energy is released when those forces are broken. Nuclear energy can be released from atoms by splitting apart the nucleus of an atom to form smaller atoms, a process known as nuclear fission. During nuclear fission, a small atomic particle called a neutron hits the uranium atom and splits it, releasing a great amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. More neutrons are also released when the uranium atom splits. These neutrons go on to bombard other uranium atoms, and the process repeats itself over and over again. This is called a chain reaction (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)). Nuclear power plants use the energy from nuclear fission to produce electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): Fission chain reaction – begins when a neutron bombards a U-235 atom, splitting it into two fission fragments, along with more neutrons and energy. The neutrons bombard other uranium atoms releasing more energy and more neutrons and the reaction continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.7.1: Nuclear fuel processing\n",
      "\n",
      "Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element that decays into daughter isotopes (see chapter 1 for a review of isotopes), releasing radiation energy in the process. There are three naturally occurring isotopes of uranium almost all (99.27 %) of which is uranium-238 (U238); the remainder consists of U-235 (0.72 %) and U-234 (0.006 %). U-235 is the preferred nuclear fuel because when its atoms are split (fissioned), they not only emit heat and high energy radiation but also enough neutrons to maintain a chain reaction and provide energy to power a  nuclear power plant. Uranium is found in rocks all over the world but is relatively rare and the supply is finite making it a nonrenewable energy source.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uranium usually occurs in combination with small amounts of other elements and once it is mined, the U-235 must be extracted and processed before it can be used as a fuel in a nuclear power plant to generate electricity. The process begins with exploration for uranium and the development of mines to extract the discovered ore (ore refers to rock that contains minerals of economic importance). Mining is either conventional (underground or open pit) or unconventional, such as in-place solution mining or heap leaching, which use liquid solvents to dissolve and extract the ore. Mined uranium ore (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)A) typically yields one to four pounds of uranium concentrate per ton of uranium ore (0.05% to 0.20%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\): A) Uranium ore B) Yellowcake (U3O8). Images obtained from United States Geological Survey (A) and United States Department of Energy (B).\n",
      "\n",
      "Uranium ore from a conventional mine is usually refined into uranium concentrate in a process referred to as milling. The ore is crushed and ground into fine powder that is then reacted with chemicals to separate the uranium from other minerals. The concentrated uranium product is typically a bright yellow or orange powder called yellowcake (U3O8) (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)B), and the waste stream from these operations is called mill tailings. Uranium ore in solution is also milled into yellowcake by retrieving the uranium out of the solution and concentrating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The yellowcake then undergoes conversion into uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas. This step enables the atomic segregation of the three naturally occurring uranium isotopes in to individual components. In the UF6 gas, the original concentrations of uranium isotopes are still unchanged. This gas is then sent to an enrichment plant where the isotope separation takes place and the concentration of U-235 is increased to about a 4% to 5% (compared to 0.72 % original concentration). The product, called enriched UF6 is sealed in canisters and allowed to cool and solidify before it is transported to a fuel assembly plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step in the production of nuclear fuel takes place at fuel fabrication facilities. Here, the enriched UF6 gas is reacted to form a black uranium dioxide (UO2) powder. The powder is then compressed and formed into the shape of small ceramic fuel pellets (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)A). Each ceramic pellet produces roughly the same amount of energy as 150 gallons of oil. The pellets are stacked and sealed into long metal tubes that are about 1 centimeter in diameter to form fuel rods. (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)B) fuel rods are then bundled together to make up a fuel assembly (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)C). Depending on the reactor type, there are about 179 to 264 fuel rods in each fuel assembly. A typical reactor core holds 121 to 193 fuel assemblies.\n",

      "After fabrication, fuel assemblies are transported to nuclear power plants where they are used as a source of energy for generating electricity. They are stored onsite until they are needed by the reactor operators. At this stage, the uranium is only mildly radioactive, and essentially all radiation is contained within the metal tubes. When needed, the fuel is loaded into a reactor core (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)). Typically, about one third of the reactor core (40 to 90 fuel assemblies) is changed out every 12 to 24 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common type of reactors are the pressurized water reactors (PWR) (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)) in which water is pumped through the reactor core and heated by the fission process. The water is kept under high pressure inside the reactor so it does not boil. The heated water from the reactor passes through tubes inside the steam generator where the heat is transferred to water flowing around the tubes in the steam generator. The water in the steam generator boils and turns to steam. The steam is piped to the turbines. The force of the expanding steam drives the turbines, which spin a magnet in coil of wire – the generator– to produce electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "After passing through the turbines, the steam is converted back to water by circulating it around tubes carrying cooling water in the condenser. The condensed steam – now water – is returned to the steam generators to repeat the cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three water systems (condenser, steam generator, and reactor) are separate from each other and are not permitted to mix. Water in the reactor is radioactive and is contained within the containment structure whereas water in the steam generator and condenser is nonradioactive.\n",

      "4.7.3: Benefits of Nuclear Energy\n",
      "\n",
      "By using fission, nuclear power plants generate electricity without emitting air pollutants like those emitted by fossil fuel-fired power plants. This means that financial costs related to chronic health problems caused by air pollutants such as particulate material, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone among others are significantly reduced. In addition nuclear reactors do not produce carbon dioxide while operating which means that nuclear energy does not contribute to the global warming problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another benefit of nuclear energy over fossil fuels especially coal is that uranium generates far more power per unit weight or volume. This means that less of it needs to be mined and consequently the damage to the landscapes is less especially when compared to the damage that results from coal mining such as mountaintop removal.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.7.4: The Drawbacks of Nuclear Energy\n",
      "\n",
      "The main environmental concern related to nuclear power is the creation of radioactive wastes such as uranium mill tailings, spent (used) reactor fuel, and other radioactive wastes. These materials can remain radioactive and dangerous to human health for thousands of years. Radioactive wastes are classified as low-level and high-level. By volume, most of the waste related to the nuclear power industry has a relatively low-level of radioactivity. Uranium mill tailings contain the radioactive element radium, which decays to produce radon, a radioactive gas. Most uranium mill tailings are placed near the processing facility or mill where they come from. Uranium mill tailings are covered with a barrier of material such as clay to prevent radon from escaping into the atmosphere, and they are then covered by a layer of soil, rocks, or other materials to prevent erosion of the sealing barrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other types of low-level radioactive waste are the tools, protective clothing, wiping cloths, and other disposable items that get contaminated with small amounts of radioactive dust or particles at nuclear fuel processing facilities and power plants. These materials are subject to special regulations that govern their handling, storage, and disposal so they will not come in contact with the outside environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "High-level radioactive waste consists of spent nuclear reactor fuel (i.e., fuel that is no longer useful for producing electricity). The spent reactor fuel is in a solid form consisting of small fuel pellets in long metal tubes called rods. Spent reactor fuel assemblies are initially stored in specially designed pools of water, where the water cools the fuel and acts as a radiation shield. Spent reactor fuel assemblies can also be stored in specially designed dry storage containers. An increasing number of reactor operators now store their older spent fuel in dry storage facilities using special outdoor concrete or steel containers with air cooling. There is currently no permanent disposal facility in the United States for high-level nuclear waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a nuclear reactor stops operating, it must be decommissioned. This involves safely removing the reactor and all equipment that has become radioactive from service and reducing radioactivity to a level that permits other uses of the property. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has strict rules governing nuclear power plant decommissioning that involve cleanup of radioactively contaminated plant systems and structures, and removal of the radioactive fuel.\n",
      "\n",
      "A nuclear meltdown, or uncontrolled nuclear reaction in a nuclear reactor, can potentially result in widespread contamination of air and water. Some serious nuclear and radiation accidents have occurred worldwide. The most severe accident was the Chernobyl accident of 1986 in the then Soviet Union (now Ukraine) which killed 31 people directly and sickened or caused cancer in thousands more. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011) in Japan was caused by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake that shut down power supply and a tsunami that flooded the plant’s emergency power supply. This resulted in the release of radioactivity although it did not directly result in any deaths at the time of the disaster. Another nuclear accident was the Three Mile Island accident (1979) in Pennsylvania, USA. This accident resulted in a near disastrous core meltdown that was due to a combination of human error and mechanical failure but did not result in any deaths and no cancers or otherwise have been found in follow up studies of this accident. While there are potentially devastating consequences to a nuclear meltdown, the likelihood of one occurring is extremely small. After every meltdown, including the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster, new international regulations were put in place to prevent such an event from occurring again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The processes for mining and refining uranium ore and making reactor fuel require large amounts of energy. Nuclear power plants have large amounts of metal and concrete, which also require large amounts of energy to manufacture. If fossil fuels are used for mining and refining uranium ore or in constructing the nuclear plant, then the emissions from burning those fuels could be associated with the electricity that nuclear power plants generate.\n",

      "Demanders and Suppliers of Currency in Foreign Exchange Markets\n",
      "In foreign exchange markets, demand and supply become closely interrelated, because a person or firm who demands\n",
      "one currency must at the same time supply another currency—and vice versa. To get a sense of this, it is useful to\n",
      "consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market: (1) firms that are involved in international\n",
      "trade of goods and services; (2) tourists visiting other countries; (3) international investors buying ownership (or partownership) of a foreign firm; (4) international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership.\n",
      "Let’s consider these categories in turn.\n",
      "Firms that buy and sell on international markets find that their costs for workers, suppliers, and investors are measured\n",
      "in the currency of the nation where their production occurs, but their revenues from sales are measured in the\n",
      "currency of the different nation where their sales happened. So, a Chinese firm exporting abroad will earn some other\n",
      "currency—say, U.S. dollars—but will need Chinese yuan to pay the workers, suppliers, and investors who are based\n",
      "in China. In the foreign exchange markets, this firm will be a supplier of U.S. dollars and a demander of Chinese\n",
      "yuan.\n",
      "International tourists will supply their home currency to receive the currency of the country they are visiting. For\n",
      "example, an American tourist who is visiting China will supply U.S. dollars into the foreign exchange market and\n",
      "demand Chinese yuan.\n",
      "Financial investments that cross international boundaries, and require exchanging currency, are often divided into two\n",
      "categories. Foreign direct investment (FDI) refers to purchasing a firm (at least ten percent) in another country or\n",
      "starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example, in 2008 the Belgian beer-brewing company InBev\n",
      "bought the U.S. beer-maker Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. To make this purchase of a U.S. firm, InBev would have\n",
      "to supply euros (the currency of Belgium) to the foreign exchange market and demand U.S. dollars.\n",
      "The other kind of international financial investment, portfolio investment, involves a purely financial investment that\n",
      "does not entail any management responsibility. An example would be a U.S. financial investor who purchased bonds\n",
      "issued by the government of the United Kingdom, or deposited money in a British bank. To make such investments,\n",
      "the American investor would supply U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market and demand British pounds.\n",
      "Portfolio investment is often linked to expectations about how exchange rates will shift. Look at a U.S. financial\n",
      "investor who is considering purchasing bonds issued in the United Kingdom. For simplicity, ignore any interest paid\n",
      "by the bond (which will be small in the short run anyway) and focus on exchange rates. Say that a British pound\n",
      "is currently worth $1.50 in U.S. currency. However, the investor believes that in a month, the British pound will be\n",
      "worth $1.60 in U.S. currency. Thus, as Figure 15.2 (a) shows, this investor would change $24,000 for 16,000 British\n",
      "pounds. In a month, if the pound is indeed worth $1.60, then the portfolio investor can trade back to U.S. dollars at\n",
      "the new exchange rate, and have $25,600—a nice profit. A portfolio investor who believes that the foreign exchange\n",
      "rate for the pound will work in the opposite direction can also invest accordingly. Say that an investor expects that\n",
      "the pound, now worth $1.50 in U.S. currency, will decline to $1.40. Then, as shown in Figure 15.2 (b), that investor\n",
      "could start off with £20,000 in British currency (borrowing the money if necessary), convert it to $30,000 in U.S.\n",
      "currency, wait a month, and then convert back to approximately £21,429 in British currency—again making a nice\n",
      "profit. Of course, this kind of investing comes without guarantees, and an investor will suffer losses if the exchange\n",

      "Many portfolio investment decisions are not as simple as betting that the value of the currency will change in one\n",

      "Imagine you are running a U.S. firm that is exporting to France. You have signed a contract to deliver certain products\n",
      "and will receive 1 million euros a year from now. But you do not know how much this contract will be worth in\n",

      "what the contract will be worth, and not take a risk that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently\n",
      "is. You can hedge, which means using a financial transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your\n",
      "investments (in this case, currency risk from the contract). Specifically, you can sign a financial contract and pay a\n",
      "fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now—regardless of what the market exchange rate is\n",
      "at that time. Now, it is possible that the euro will be worth more in dollars a year from now, so your hedging contract\n",
      "will be unnecessary, and you will have paid a fee for nothing. But if the value of the euro in dollars declines, then you\n",
      "are protected by the hedge. Financial contracts like hedging, where parties wish to be protected against exchange rate\n",
      "movements, also commonly lead to a series of portfolio investments by the firm that is receiving a fee to provide the\n",

      "Step 1. Note that the demand for U.S. exports is a function of the price of those exports, which depends on\n",
      "the dollar price of those goods and the exchange rate of the dollar in terms of foreign currency. For example,\n",
      "a Ford pickup truck costs $25,000 in the United States. When it is sold in the United Kingdom, the price\n",
      "is $25,000 / $1.50 per British pound, or £16,667. The dollar affects the price faced by foreigners who may\n",
      "purchase U.S. exports.\n",
      "Step 2. Consider that, if the dollar weakens, the pound rises in value. If the pound rises to $2.00 per pound,\n",
      "then the price of a Ford pickup is now $25,000 / $2.00 = £12,500. A weaker dollar means the foreign currency\n",
      "buys more dollars, which means that U.S. exports appear less expensive.\n",
      "Step 3. Summarize that a weaker U.S. dollar leads to an increase in U.S. exports. For a foreign exporter, the\n",
      "outcome is just the opposite.\n",
      "Step 4. Suppose a brewery in England is interested in selling its Bass Ale to a grocery store in the United\n",
      "States. If the price of a six pack of Bass Ale is £6.00 and the exchange rate is $1.50 per British pound, the\n",
      "price for the grocery store is 6.00 × $1.50 = $9.00 per six pack. If the dollar weakens to $2.00 per pound, the\n",
      "price of Bass Ale is now 6.00 × $2.00 = $12.\n",
      "Step 5. Summarize that, from the perspective of U.S. purchasers, a weaker dollar means that foreign currency\n",
      "is more expensive, which means that foreign goods are more expensive also. This leads to a decrease in U.S.\n",
      "imports, which is bad for the foreign exporter.\n",
      "Step 6. Consider U.S. tourists going abroad. They face the same situation as a U.S. importer—they are\n",
      "purchasing a foreign trip. A weaker dollar means that their trip will cost more, since a given expenditure of\n",
      "foreign currency (e.g., hotel bill) will take more dollars. The result is that the tourist may not stay as long\n",
      "abroad, and some may choose not to travel at all.\n",
      "Step 7. Consider that, for the foreign tourist to the United States, a weaker dollar is a boon. It means their\n",
      "currency goes further, so the cost of a trip to the United States will be less. Foreigners may choose to take\n",
      "longer trips to the United States, and more foreign tourists may decide to take U.S. trips.\n",
      "Step 8. Note that a U.S. investor abroad faces the same situation as a U.S. importer—they are purchasing a\n",
      "foreign asset. A U.S. investor will see a weaker dollar as an increase in the “price” of investment, since the\n",
      "same number of dollars will buy less foreign currency and thus less foreign assets. This should decrease the\n",
      "amount of U.S. investment abroad.\n",

      "likely effects of such an article are illustrated in Figure 15.6. Demand for the Mexican peso shifts to the right, from\n",
      "D0 to D1, as investors become eager to purchase pesos. Conversely, the supply of pesos shifts to the left, from S0\n",
      "to S1, because investors will be less willing to give them up. The result is that the equilibrium exchange rate rises\n",
      "from 10 cents/peso to 12 cents/peso and the equilibrium exchange rate rises from 85 billion to 90 billion pesos as the\n",
      "equilibrium moves from E0 to E1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 15.6 Exchange Rate Market for Mexican Peso Reacts to Expectations about Future Exchange Rates\n",
      "An announcement that the peso exchange rate is likely to strengthen in the future will lead to greater demand for the\n",
      "peso in the present from investors who wish to benefit from the appreciation. Similarly, it will make investors less\n",
      "likely to supply pesos to the foreign exchange market. Both the shift of demand to the right and the shift of supply to\n",
      "the left cause an immediate appreciation in the exchange rate.\n",

      "contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered, in the foreign exchange market, supply and\n",
      "demand typically both move at the same time. Groups of participants in the foreign exchange market like firms and\n",
      "investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers. An expectation of a future shift in the exchange rate\n",
      "affects both buyers and sellers—that is, it affects both demand and supply for a currency.\n",
      "The shifts in demand and supply curves both cause the exchange rate to shift in the same direction; in this example,\n",
      "they both make the peso exchange rate stronger. However, the shifts in demand and supply work in opposing\n",
      "directions on the quantity traded. In this example, the rising demand for pesos is causing the quantity to rise while the\n",

      "cases, the result could be that quantity remains unchanged or declines.\n",
      "This example also helps to explain why exchange rates often move quite substantially in a short period of a few weeks\n",
      "or months. When investors expect a country’s currency to strengthen in the future, they buy the currency and cause it\n",
      "to appreciate immediately. The appreciation of the currency can lead other investors to believe that future appreciation\n",
      "is likely—and thus lead to even further appreciation. Similarly, a fear that a currency might weaken quickly leads to\n",

      "buying the currency of other countries, like U.S. dollars or euros, to hold as reserves. Holding large reserves of other\n",

      "In addition, a central bank that causes a large increase in the supply of money is also risking an inflationary surge in\n",
      "aggregate demand. Conversely, when a central bank wishes to buy its own currency, it can do so by using its reserves\n",

      "LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n",
      "\n",
      "Describe signal summation\n",
      "\n",
      "Each neuron connects with numerous other neurons, often receiving multiple impulses from them. Sometimes, a single excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential. Summation, either spatial or temporal, is the addition of these impulses at the axon hillock. Together, synaptic summation and the threshold for excitation act as a filter so that random “noise” in the system is not transmitted as important information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Signal summation at the axon hillock: A single neuron can receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from multiple neurons. All these inputs are added together at the axon hillock. If the EPSPs are strong enough to overcome the IPSPs and reach the threshold of excitation, the neuron will fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "One neuron often has input from many presynaptic neurons, whether excitatory or inhibitory; therefore, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa. The net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an action potential. If the neuron only receives excitatory impulses, it will also generate an action potential. However, if the neuron receives as many inhibitory as excitatory impulses, the inhibition cancels out the excitation and the nerve impulse will stop there. Spatial summation means that the effects of impulses received at different places on the neuron add up so that the neuron may fire when such impulses are received simultaneously, even if each impulse on its own would not be sufficient to cause firing. Temporal summation means that the effects of impulses received at the same place can add up if the impulses are received in close temporal succession. Thus, the neuron may fire when multiple impulses are received, even if each impulse on its own would not be sufficient to cause firing.\n",

      "\n",
      "Secondary metabolites are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development, or reproduction of an organism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polyketides are usually biosynthesized through the decarboxylative condensation of malonyl-CoA derived extender units in a similar process to fatty acid biosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polyketides are structurally a very diverse family of natural products with diverse biological activities and pharmacological properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Terms\n",
      "\n",
      "Polyketides: Polyketides are secondary metabolites from bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Polyketides are usually biosynthesized through the decarboxylative condensation of malonyl-CoA derived extender units in a similar process to fatty acid synthesis (a Claisen condensation).\n",
      "\n",
      "metabolites: Metabolites are the intermediates and products of metabolism. The term metabolite is usually restricted to small molecules. Metabolites have various functions, including fuel, structure, signaling, stimulatory and inhibitory effects on enzymes, catalytic activity of their own (usually as a cofactor to an enzyme), defense, and interactions with other organisms (e.g. pigments, odorants, and pheromones).\n",
      "\n",
      "biosynthesized: Biosynthesis (also called biogenesis or “anabolism”) is an enzyme-catalyzed process in cells of living organisms by which substrates are converted to more complex products. The biosynthesis process often consists of several enzymatic steps in which the product of one step is used as substrate in the following step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polyketides are secondary metabolites produced from bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondary metabolites are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development, or reproduction of an organism. Unlike primary metabolites, the absence of secondary metabolites does not result in immediate death, but rather in long-term impairment of the organism’s survivability, fecundity, or aesthetics, or perhaps in no significant change at all. Secondary metabolites are often restricted to a narrow set of species within a phylogenetic group. Secondary metabolites often play an important role in plant defense against herbivory and other interspecies defenses. Humans use secondary metabolites as medicines, flavorings, and recreational drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tetracycline structural formula\n",
      "\n",
      "Polyketides are usually biosynthesized through the decarboxylative condensation of malonyl-CoA derived extender units in a similar process to fatty acid biosynthesis (a Claisen condensation). The polyketide chains produced by a minimal polyketide synthase are often further derivitized and modified into bioactive natural products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polyketides are structurally a very diverse family of natural products with diverse biological activities and pharmacological properties. They are broadly divided into three classes: type I polyketides (often macrolides produced by multimodular megasynthases), type II polyketides (often aromatic molecules produced by the iterative action of dissociated enzymes ), and type III polyketides (often small aromatic molecules produced by fungal species). Polyketide antibiotics, antifungals, cytostatics, anticholesteremic, antiparasitics, coccidiostats, animal growth promoters, and natural insecticides are in commercial use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of polyketides include: Macrolides; Pikromycin, the first isolated macrolide; the antibiotics erythromycin A; clarithromycin, and azithromycin; the immunosuppressant tacrolimus; Radicicol and Pochonin family (HSP90 inhibitor); Polyene antibiotics; Amphotericin; Tetracyclines and the tetracycline family of antibiotics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polyketides are synthesized by one or more specialized and highly complex polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes.\n",

      "Agrupando y manipulando data\n",
      "\n",
      "Como hemos visto, gran parte de la programación consiste en agrupar y manipular data. Esto nos permite transformar datos en información y utilizar esa información para resolver problemas. Hasta ahora hemos podido agrupar y manipular data haciendo uso de tipos de datos simples como: numbers,booleans y strings. Sobre ellos hemos creado una serie de programas sencillos. También hemos aprendido a modificar el control de flujo de estos programas, por medio de estructuras repetitivas, estructuras condicionales y funciones, lo cual nos ha permitido crear productos un poco más complejos. Sin embargo, nuestros programas han estado seriamente limitados debido a que operan únicamente con tipos de datos simples. Para resolver problemas más complejos necesitamos poder agrupar y manipular data de una manera más interesante. Afortunadamente, un entorno JavaScript nos permite lograr esto brindándonos arrays y objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "¿Por qué necesitamos arrays?\n",
      "\n",
      "Digamos, por poner un ejemplo, que queremos representar una colección de números: 2, 3, 5, 7 y 11.\n",
      "\n",
      "Una opción para representar esto sería:\n",
      "\n",
      "const firstNumber = 2;\n",
      "const secondNumber = 3;\n",
      "const thirdNumber = 5;\n",
      "const fourthNumber = 7;\n",
      "\n",
      "Esta lista es bien extraña y engorrosa. Implica tener una variable para cada\n",
      "elemento de nuestra lista. Cuando en realidad sólo deberíamos tener una sola\n",
      "variable que \"contenga\" a cada una.¡Imagina que luego quieres tener una lista\n",
      "de 1,000 elementos!\n",
      "\n",
      "Otra opción -más creativa- sería utilizar un string. Después de todo, los strings pueden ser de cualquier longitud, así que podemos poner mucha información en ellos. Podríamos usar un string con los números intercalados por un espacio, así:\n",
      "\n",
      "let listOfNumbers = '2 3 5 7 11';\n",
      "\n",
      "Sin embargo, esto también resulta engorroso. Tendríamos que buscar la manera de extraer cada elemento del string (contando los espacios entre ellos) y además, tendríamos que convertirlos de vuelta a number para acceder y manipular cada número de manera individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afortunadamente, Javascript proporciona un tipo de dato específico para almacenar secuencias de valores. Se llama array (arreglo en español) y se escribe como una lista de valores entre corchetes, separados por comas.\n",
      "\n",
      "listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];\n",
      "\n",
      "Los arrays son tremendamente útiles para agrupar y manipular data. Es como cuando vamos al mercado y tenemos nuestra \"lista de compras\". Podríamos tener una hoja de papel para cada artículo que queremos comprar. Por ejemplo, podríamos tener una hoja de papel que dice \"huevos\", otra hoja que dice \"pan\", y otra hoja que dice \"naranjas\". Sin embargo, la mayoría de la gente escribe la lista completa de cosas a comprar en una sola hoja de papel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accediendo información de un array\n",
      "\n",
      "Antes de comenzar, vamos a generar una pequeña función utilitaria, que nos permita decir si dos string son iguales. La colocaremos en el prototype de Array.\n",
      "\n",
      "const equal = (one, other) => JSON.stringify(one) === JSON.stringify(other);\n",
      "\n",
      "console.assert(equal([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]));\n",
      "console.assert(!equal([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']));\n",
      "console.assert(!equal([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]));\n",
      "\n",
      "Para obtener un elemento dentro de un array, se utiliza la notación con corchetes, con el index (índice en español) del elemento que se desea. Veamos un ejemplo:\n",
      "\n",
      "listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];\n",
      "\n",
      "console.assert(listOfNumbers[1] === 3);\n",
      "console.assert(listOfNumbers[1 - 1] === 2);\n",
      "\n",
      "El index es el número que corresponde a (o que coincide con) el punto del array donde se almacena el valor. Al igual que con los strings, el primer elemento de un array está en el index 0, el segundo está en el index 1, el tercero en el index 2, y así sucesivamente. Es por eso que pedir index 1 - 1 (es decir, 0) del array anterior devuelve el número 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Si no tienes antecedentes en programación, acostumbrarte a esta convención puede\n",
      "tomarte algún tiempo. Pero el conteo con base cero tiene una larga tradición en\n",
      "tecnología y mientras la convención se siga de manera consistente (que se ha hecho\n",
      "en Javascript), funciona bien.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definiendo o cambiando los elementos de un array\n",
      "\n",
      "Podemos utilizar los indexes entre corchetes para establecer, cambiar o incluso agregar elementos a un array. Por ejemplo, para reemplazar el primer elemento del array listOfNumbers por el número 1, podríamos hacer lo siguiente:\n",
      "\n",
      "listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];\n",
      "listOfNumbers[0] = 1;\n",
      "\n",
      "console.assert(\n",
      "  equal(listOfNumbers, [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]),\n",
      ");\n",
      "\n",
      "También podemos utilizar los indexes entre corchetes para agregar elementos en un array. Por ejemplo, para agregar el número 13 al array listOfNumbers, haríamos lo siguiente:\n",
      "\n",
      "listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];\n",
      "listOfNumbers[5] = 13;\n",

      "  equal(listOfNumbers, [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]),\n",
      ");\n",
      "\n",
      "De hecho, podemos crear un array vacío y luego definir cada elemento de forma individual, así:\n",
      "\n",
      "listOfNumbers = [];\n",
      "listOfNumbers[0] = 2;\n",
      "listOfNumbers[1] = 3;\n",
      "listOfNumbers[2] = 5;\n",
      "listOfNumbers[3] = 7;\n",
      "listOfNumbers[4] = 11;\n",
      "\n",
      "console.assert(\n",
      "  equal(listOfNumbers, [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]),\n",
      ");\n",
      "\n",
      "Mezclando tipos de datos en arrays\n",
      "\n",
      "Los elementos de un array no tienen que ser todos del mismo tipo de dato. Podemos, por ejemplo, tener un array que contenga un number (el número 3), un string (\"hola mundo\") y otro number (el número 3627.5):\n",

      "const mixedArray = [3, 'hola mundo', 3627.5];\n",

      "console.assert(mixedArray[2] === 3627.5);\n",
      "\n",
      "Inclusive podemos tener un array dentro de otro array (algo que mucha gente llama arrays de 2 dimensiones). Por ejemplo, para organizar la data de preguntas y respuestas de un quiz, podemos utilizar un array en el que cada elemento es, a su vez, un array que tiene dos elementos: una pregunta y una respuesta.\n",

Recuerda además que, al quemarse 1 mol de metano, se produce 1 mol de CO2, si se quema 1 mol de etano se producen 2 moles de CO2, si se quema un mol de propano, se producen 3 moles de CO2 y si se quema un mol de butano se producen 4 moles de CO2. por tanto ¿Cuantas moles de CO2 se producen? ¿ Cuántos Kg ?

      "There are alternatives to using op amp based integrators and differentiators. As long as systems can be described by a reasonable set of equations, simulation using digital computers is possible. The primary advantages of a digital computer-based simulation scheme is that it is very flexible and potentially very accurate. Before the rise of affordable and powerful desktop digital computers, the speed of response of the digital technique was a severe limitation. Analog computers can be configured as real-time or faster-than-real-time devices: they respond at the same speed or faster than the system that is being simulated. The typically heavy computation load of the digital computer requires prodigious calculation speed to keep up with reasonably fast processes. Fortunately, this is no longer the problem it once was. Another advantage of the analog computer is its immediacy. It is by nature, interactive. This means that an operator can change simulation parameters and immediately see the result. Finally, there are some applications for which the added cost of the computing hardware cannot be justified. If these are not issues, then a digital-based simulation will most likely be preferred. The general idea is to calculate the response for several closely spaced points in time. The results may be used in a variety of ways. For example, graphs may be created that can then be studied at leisure or the resulting digital signal may be used elsewhere in the system. An extreme (although generally impractical) possibility is to design an op amp based simulator and then simulate its response by using a digital circuit simulator! As you might guess, this double simulation is not particularly efficient, especially with large systems.\n",

      "- My name is Beth Schmidt and my organization is called Wishbone.org. I started Wishbone to actually send low-income students on these after-school and summer programs that are otherwise pretty much cost-prohibitive for that demographic. I was teaching tenth grade English in South Central Los Angeles. And I said, \"Go research any after-school or summer program in the Los Angeles area.\" And part of the research paper was to match a passion to this after-school program or summer program that the student wanted to attend. There were about thirteen papers that started with the sentence \"Nobody's ever asked me what my passion is.\" And so I'm sitting there heartbroken, thinking (laughing) I have to send these kids on these programs. But I was on a teacher's salary at the time, so I can't afford to send them all. I actually ran a marathon to raise the money to send seven of them. Took the teacher room and I stapled together packets of my students' wishes. They each wrote a paragraph, an excerpt from their essay, about why they wanted to attend the program they chose. I took a photo of each student and I mailed it out to friends and family. I like to err on the side of transparency just because I think it motivates people to give more. Any donor wants to know where their dollars are going. That was really part of the whole design for Wishbone. People could actually see what the dream for the student was, and they could see the price tag to say, \"OK, my donation is actually making a difference.\" So it all started with the teacher packet. We had one student who is taking flight lessons. I think he did over 60 hours this summer of flight school with Wishbone. We have other students who want to go to ID Tech Camp and learn how to code. We have some students who want to learn about stem cell science. These kids actually come back into their school day and become the experts on whatever they've done. It's powerful, what can happen within a single community when one kid comes back and has that a-ha moment. It's incredibly powerful to see peer groups come together and realize I can do that too. It took about a year to really think about whether I was going to pursue this full-time. And then I dove right in. I realized I didn't want to run a marathon again. That was the year I said, \"I need to figure out a new, sustainable method for sending kids on programs.\" There's very humbling moments where you're constantly learning and iterating. I remember when Wishbone earned it's first $25,000 and I thought, \"The organization's made.\" The you realize, oh boy, this isn't gonna get me very far. So it's a roller coaster. But a piece that's unwavering is your solid belief that this is an issue and there's a specific solution to it. So for Wishbone, it's really clear. There's an opportunity gap. Low-income kids are prohibited from path-changing opportunities. And the solution is to get them those opportunities. That is the piece you can not waver on. The future of philanthropy, I believe, is definitely through technology. We have so much capacity to be able to give online. And it's one of the last fields, actually, to come online.\n",

      "\n",
      "Volunteers answer\n",
      "Students are invited to put their hands up in order to indicate that they would like to volunteer the answer.\n",
      "The thinking time is usually very short and if students call out the answer instead of putting their hand up\n",
      "then the thinking time for other students is even less. This method has low participation – the same\n",
      "students tend to volunteer. Students learn that if they don’t put their hand up they will not be asked. One\n",
      "reason teachers tend to like this method is it does not put students under pressure. Only those who want to\n",
      "answer have to.\n",
      "If this method is used with closed questions, the opportunities for dialogue and feedback are limited\n",
      "because the people who volunteer are likely to be the ones who know the correct answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "A nominee answers\n",
      "Students are nominated by the teacher to answer a question. This has the advantage of increasing the\n",
      "thinking time. The teacher asks the question and pauses, giving the students a chance to think. The teacher\n",
      "then nominates someone to answer the question. This also increases participation as the teacher will often\n",
      "choose people who are reluctant to volunteer. However, this can make students feel uncomfortable and\n",
      "teachers can be tempted to limit the challenge of the questions in order to help students who feel\n",
      "uncomfortable with this technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bouncing\n",
      "When a student answers a question, instead of saying whether it is right or wrong, the teacher asks someone\n",
      "else to respond. For example, ‘What do you think, Sanjay? Is there anything you can add to that, Ditta?’\n",
      "This increases the level of participation and gives students the chance to think a bit more about possible\n",
      "answers. It also increases the amount of dialogue in the classroom and gives the teacher the chance to ask a\n",
      "more demanding question, or one that requires a longer answer. The person the question is ‘bounced to’ can\n",
      "be a volunteer or a nominee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pairs/groups\n",
      "Students work in small groups or pairs to answer questions. Students work in small groups or pairs to\n",
      "answer a thought-provoking question or to complete a short task. The teacher can then ask each group in\n",
      "turn to contribute part of the answer, allowing a volunteer within the group to answer. For example, ‘What\n",
      "sorts of things cause disease? Can you give me one cause for disease?’ Then the teacher would move on to\n",
      "another group for a different cause.\n",
      "Alternatively, the teacher might nominate an individual in advance of the discussion. The nominated student\n",
      "answers on behalf of the group, but they have chance to talk to the rest of the group so that they are\n",
      "confident about their reply.\n",
      "This method promotes high participation. It enables the teacher to ask challenging questions and gives\n",

      "A microbe that is capable of causing disease is referred to as a pathogen, while the organism being infected is called a host. The ability to cause disease is referred to as pathogenicity, with pathogens varying in their ability. An opportunistic pathogen is a microbe that typically infects a host that is compromised in some way, either by a weakened immune system or breach to the body’s natural defenses, such as a wound. The measurement of pathogenicity is called virulence, with highly virulent pathogens being more likely to cause disease in a host.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to remember that there are many variables to take into account in a host-pathogen interaction, which is a dynamic relationship that is constantly changing. The virulence of the pathogen is important, but so is the number of microbes that gained entry to the host, the location of entry, the overall health of the host, and the state of the host’s defenses. Exposure to a pathogen does not ensure that disease will occur, since a host might be able to fight off the infection before disease signs/symptoms develop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Host-Pathogen Interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pathogen Transmission\n",
      "\n",
      "An infection starts with exposure to a pathogen. The natural site or home for a pathogen is known as a reservoir and can either be animate (human or animal) or inanimate (water, soil, food).  A pathogen can be picked up from its reservoir and then spread from one infected host to another. Carriers play an important role in the spread of disease, since they carry the pathogen but show no obvious symptoms of disease. A disease that primarily occurs within animal populations but can be spread to humans is called a zoonosis, while a hospital-acquired infection is known as a nosocomial infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mechanism by which a pathogen is picked up by a host is referred to as mode of transmission, with the main mechanisms listed below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Direct contact\n",
      "\n",
      "Direct contact includes host-to-host contact, such as through kissing or sexual intercourse, where one person might come in contact with another person’s skin or body fluids. An expectant mother may transmit a pathogen to her infant by vertical contact while pregnant, or during the act of giving birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Droplet transmission\n",
      "\n",
      "Droplet transmission is often considered to be a form of direct contact as well. It involves transmission by respiratory droplets, where an infected host expels the pathogen in tiny droplets by coughing or sneezing, which are then inhaled by a host nearby. These droplets are not transmitted through the air over long distances, nor do they remain infectious for very long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indirect contact\n",
      "\n",
      "Indirect contact involves the transfer of the infectious agent through some type of intermediary, such as a contaminated object or person. The pathogen might be deposited on an inanimate object, called a fomite, which is then used by another person. This could include a shared toy or commonly-touched surface, like a doorknob or computer keyboard. Alternatively, a healthcare worked might transmit a pathogen from one patient to another, if they did not change their gloves between patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Airborne transmission\n",
      "\n",
      "Airborne transmission occurs due to pathogens that are in small particles or droplets in the environment, which can remain infectious over time and distance. An example might be fungal spores that are inhaled during a dust storm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fecal-oral transmission\n",
      "\n",
      "Fecal-oral transmission occurs when an infected host is shedding the pathogen in their feces which contaminate food or water that is consumed by the next host.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vectorborne transmission\n",
      "\n",
      "Vectorborne transmission occurs when an arthropod vector, such as mosquitoes, flies, ticks, are involves in the transmission. Sometimes the vector just picks up the infectious agents on their external body parts and carries it to another host, but typically the vector picks up the infectious agent when biting an infected host. The agent is picked up in the blood, and then spread to the next host when the vector moves on to bite someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pathogen Transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virulence Factors\n",
      "\n",
      "In order for a bacterium to be virulent, it must have capabilities that allow it to infect a host. These capabilities arise from physical structures that the bacterium has or chemical substances that the bacterium can produce. Collectively the characteristics that contribute to virulence are called virulence factors (https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Book%3A_Microbiology_(OpenStax)/15%3A_Microbial_Mechanisms_of_Pathogenicity/15.3%3A_Virulence_Factors). The genes that code for virulence factors are commonly found clustered on the pathogen’s chromosome or plasmid DNA, called pathogenicity islands. These pathogenicity islands can be distinguished by a G+C content that differs from the rest of the genome and the presence of insertion-like sequences flanking the gene cluster. Pathogenicity islands facilitate the sharing of virulence factors between bacteria due to horizontal gene transfer, leading to the development of new pathogens over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often the genes for virulence factors are controlled by quorum sensing, to ensure gene activation when the pathogen population is at an optimal density. Triggering the genes too soon could alert the host’s immune system to the invader, cutting short the bacterial infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adherence and Colonization\n",
      "\n",
      "Bacterial pathogens must be able to grab onto host cells or tissue, and resist removal by physical means (such as sneezing) or mechanical means (such as movement of the cilated cells that line our airway). Adherence can involve polysaccharide layers made by the bacteria, such as a capsule or slime layer, which provide adhesion to host cells as well as resistance from phagocytosis. Adherence can also be accomplished by physical structures such as a pilus or flagellum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once cells are successfully adhering to a surface, they increase in number, utilizing resources available at the site. This colonization is important for pathogen survival and invasion to other sites, which will yield increased nutrients and space for the growing population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Invasion\n",
      "\n",
      "Invasion refers to the ability of the pathogen to spread to other locations in the host, by invading host cells or tissue. It is typically at this point when disease or obvious signs/symptoms of illness will occur. While physical structures can still play a role in invasion, most bacterial pathogens produce a wide array of chemicals, specifically enzymes that effect the host’s cells and tissue. Enzymes such as collagenase, which allows the pathogen to spread by breaking down the collagen found in connective tissue. Or leukocidins, which destroy the host’s white blood cells, decreasing resistance. Hemolysins lyse the host’s red blood cells, releasing iron, a growth-limiting factor for bacteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bacteria in the bloodstream, a condition known as bacteremia, can quickly spread to locations throughout the host. This can result in a massive, systemic infection known as septicemia, which can result in septic shock and death, as the host becomes overwhelmed by the bacterial pathogen and its products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toxins\n",
      "\n",
      "Toxins are a very specific virulence factor produced by some bacterial pathogens, in the form of substances that are poisonous to the host. Toxigenicity refers to an organism’s ability to make toxins. For bacteria, there are two categories of toxins, the exotoxins and the endotoxins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exotoxins\n",
      "\n",
      "Exotoxins are heat-sensitive soluble proteins that are released into the surrounding environment by a living organism. These incredibly potent substances can spread throughout the host’s body, causing damage distant from the original site of infection. Exotoxins are associated with specific diseases, with the toxin genes often carried on plasmids or by prophages. There are many different bacteria that produce exotoxins, causing diseases such as botulism, tetanus, and diphtheria. There are three categories of exotoxins:\n",
      "\n",
      "Type I: cell surface-active – these toxins bind to cell receptors and stimulate cell responses. One example is superantigen, that stimulates the host’s T cells, an important component of the immune system. The stimulated T cells produce an excessive amount of the signaling molecule cytokine, causing massive inflammation and tissue damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Type II: membrane-damaging – these toxins exert their effect on the host cell membrane, often by forming pores in the membrane of the target cell. This can lead to cell lysis as cytoplasmic contents rush out and water rushes in, disrupting the osmotic balance of the cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Type III: intracellular – these toxins gain access to a particular host cell and stimulate a reaction within the target cell. One example is the AB-toxin – these toxins are composed of two subunits, an A portion and a B portion. The B subunit is the binding portion of the toxin, responsible for recognizing and binding to the correct cell type. The A subunit is the portion with enzymatic activity. Once delivered into the correct cell by the B subunit, the A subunit enacts some mechanism on the cell, leading to decreased cell function and/or cell death. An example is the tetanus toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridrium tetani. Once delivered to a neuron, the A subunit will cleave the cellular synaptobreven, resulting in a decrease in neurotransmitter release. This results in spastic paralysis of the host. Each AB-toxin is associated with a different disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "AB-toxin: Host Cell Binding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Endotoxins\n",
      "\n",
      "Endotoxins are made by gram negative bacteria, as a component of the outer membrane of their cell wall. The outer membrane contains lipopolysaccharide or LPS, with the toxic component being the lipid part known as lipid A. Lipid A is heat-stable and is only released when the bacterial cell is lysed. The effect on the host is the same, regardless of what bacterium made the lipid A – fever, diarrhea, weakness, and blood coagulation. A massive release of endotoxin in a host can cause endotoxin shock, which can be deadly.\n",

Para ello, se ha implementado una función (applyDiscount(cart, discount)) que recibe un arreglo de objetos (el cart), cada uno con un precio, y un porcentaje de descuento.

      "A string can use certain specifications and subsequently, the format method can be called to substitute those specifications with corresponding arguments to the format method.\n",
      "\n",
      "Observe the first usage where we use {0} and this corresponds to the variable name which is the first argument to the format method. Similarly, the second specification is {1} corresponding to age which is the second argument to the format method. Note that Python starts counting from 0 which means that first position is at index 0, second position is at index 1, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that we could have achieved the same using string concatenation:\n",
      "\n",
      "name + ' is ' + str(age) + ' years old'\n",
      "\n",
      "but that is much uglier and error-prone. Second, the conversion to string would be done automatically by the format method instead of the explicit conversion to strings needed in this case. Third, when using the format method, we can change the message without having to deal with the variables used and vice-versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also note that the numbers are optional, so you could have also written as:\n",
      "\n",
      "age = 20 name = 'Swaroop'  print('{} was {} years old when he wrote this book'.format(name, age)) print('Why is {} playing with that python?'.format(name))\n",
      "\n",
      "which will give the same exact output as the previous program.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can also name the parameters:\n",
      "\n",
      "age = 20 name = 'Swaroop'  print('{name} was {age} years old when he wrote this book'.format(name=name, age=age)) print('Why is {name} playing with that python?'.format(name=name))\n",
      "\n",
      "which will give the same exact output as the previous program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python 3.6 introduced a shorter way to do named parameters, called \"f-strings\":\n",
      "\n",
      "age = 20 name = 'Swaroop'  print(f'{name} was {age} years old when he wrote this book')  # notice the 'f' before the string print(f'Why is {name} playing with that python?')  # notice the 'f' before the string\n",
      "\n",
      "which will give the same exact output as the previous program.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Python does in the format method is that it substitutes each argument value into the place of the specification. There can be more detailed specifications such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "# decimal (.) precision of 3 for float '0.333' print('{0:.3f}'.format(1.0/3)) # fill with underscores (_) with the text centered # (^) to 11 width '___hello___' print('{0:_^11}'.format('hello')) # keyword-based 'Swaroop wrote A Byte of Python' print('{name} wrote {book}'.format(name='Swaroop', book='A Byte of Python'))\n",

      "___hello___\n",
      "Swaroop wrote A Byte of Python\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we are discussing formatting, note that print always ends with an invisible \"new line\" character (\\n) so that repeated calls to print will all print on a separate line each. To prevent this newline character from being printed, you can specify that it should end with a blank:\n",

      "\n",
      "Suppose, you want to have a string which contains a single quote ('), how will you specify this string? For example, the string is \"What's your name?\". You cannot specify 'What's your name?' because Python will be confused as to where the string starts and ends. So, you will have to specify that this single quote does not indicate the end of the string. This can be done with the help of what is called an escape sequence. You specify the single quote as \\' : notice the backslash. Now, you can specify the string as 'What\\'s your name?'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way of specifying this specific string would be \"What's your name?\" i.e. using double quotes. Similarly, you have to use an escape sequence for using a double quote itself in a double quoted string. Also, you have to indicate the backslash itself using the escape sequence \\\\.\n",
      "\n",
      "What if you wanted to specify a two-line string? One way is to use a triple-quoted string as shown previously or you can use an escape sequence for the newline character - \\n to indicate the start of a new line. An example is:\n",
      "\n",
      "'This is the first line\\nThis is the second line'\n",
      "\n",
      "Another useful escape sequence to know is the tab: \\t. There are many more escape sequences but I have mentioned only the most useful ones here.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing to note is that in a string, a single backslash at the end of the line indicates that the string is continued in the next line, but no newline is added. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the first sentence. \\ This is the second sentence.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Raw String\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Using just literal constants can soon become boring - we need some way of storing any information and manipulate them as well. This is where variables come into the picture. Variables are exactly what the name implies - their value can vary, i.e., you can store anything using a variable. Variables are just parts of your computer's memory where you store some information. Unlike literal constants, you need some method of accessing these variables and hence you give them names.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here's how this program works. First, we assign the literal constant value 5 to the variable i using the assignment operator (=). This line is called a statement because it states that something should be done and in this case, we connect the variable name i to the value 5. Next, we print the value of i using the print statement which, unsurprisingly, just prints the value of the variable to the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we add 1 to the value stored in i and store it back. We then print it and expectedly, we get the value 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, we assign the literal string to the variable s and then print it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note for static language programmers\n",
      "\n",
      "Variables are used by just assigning them a value. No declaration or data type definition is needed/used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Logical And Physical Line\n",
      "\n",
      "A physical line is what you see when you write the program. A logical line is what Python sees as a single statement. Python implicitly assumes that each physical line corresponds to a logical line.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of a logical line is a statement like print('hello world') - if this was on a line by itself (as you see it in an editor), then this also corresponds to a physical line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implicitly, Python encourages the use of a single statement per line which makes code more readable.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to specify more than one logical line on a single physical line, then you have to explicitly specify this using a semicolon (;) which indicates the end of a logical line/statement. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "i = 5 print(i)\n",
      "\n",
      "is effectively same as\n",
      "\n",
      "i = 5; print(i);\n",
      "\n",
      "which is also same as\n",
      "\n",
      "i = 5; print(i);\n",
      "\n",
      "and same as\n",
      "\n",
      "i = 5; print(i)\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I strongly recommend that you stick to writing a maximum of a single logical line on each single physical line. The idea is that you should never use the semicolon. In fact, I have never used or even seen a semicolon in a Python program.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one kind of situation where this concept is really useful: if you have a long line of code, you can break it into multiple physical lines by using the backslash. This is referred to as explicit line joining:\n",
      "\n",
      "s = 'This is a string. \\ This continues the string.' print(s)\n",
      "\n",
      "Output:\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a string. This continues the string.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "i = \\ 5\n",
      "\n",
      "is the same as\n",
      "\n",
      "i = 5\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, there is an implicit assumption where you don't need to use a backslash. This is the case where the logical line has a starting parentheses, starting square brackets or a starting curly braces but not an ending one. This is called implicit line joining. You can see this in action when we write programs using list in later chapters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indentation\n",
      "\n",
      "Whitespace is important in Python. Actually, whitespace at the beginning of the line is important. This is called indentation. Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of the logical line is used to determine the indentation level of the logical line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that statements which go together must have the same indentation. Each such set of statements is called a block. We will see examples of how blocks are important in later chapters.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing you should remember is that wrong indentation can give rise to errors. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "i = 5 # Error below! Notice a single space at the start of the line  print('Value is', i) print('I repeat, the value is', i)\n",
      "\n",
      "When you run this, you get the following error:\n",
      "\n",
      "File \"whitespace.py\", line 3\n",
      "    print('Value is', i)\n",
      "    ^\n",
      "IndentationError: unexpected indent\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that there is a single space at the beginning of the second line. The error indicated by Python tells us that the syntax of the program is invalid i.e. the program was not properly written. What this means to you is that you cannot arbitrarily start new blocks of statements (except for the default main block which you have been using all along, of course). Cases where you can use new blocks will be detailed in later chapters such as the control flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to indent\n",
      "\n",
      "Use four spaces for indentation. This is the official Python language recommendation. Good editors will automatically do this for you. Make sure you use a consistent number of spaces for indentation, otherwise your program will not run or will have unexpected behavior.\n",

The purpose of this course is to introduce future elementary (grades K-6) educators to the basic language of mathematics, and to give them an introduction to abstract concepts in set theory, geometry, probability, and statistics. The relationship of concepts to the elementary mathematics curriculum is emphasized. We started offering this course in Fall 2013. I have been teaching this course since its inception. I have created these lecture notes to facilitate student learning. This course partially fulfills the need for mathematics to be taught as a language with reasoning and gives students spatial sense.

      "\n",
      "Section 10.1 showed that relativity requires magnetic forces to exist, and section 10.2 gave us a peek at what this implies about or how electric and magnetic fields transform. To understand this on a more general basis, let’s explicitly list some assumptions about the electric field and see how they lead to the existence and properties of a magnetic field:\n",
      "\n",
      "Definition of the electric field: In the frame of reference of an inertial observer \\(o\\), take some standard, charged test particle, release it at rest, and observe the force \\(F_o\\) (section 4.5) acting on the particle. (The timelike component of this force vanishes.) Then the electric field three-vector \\(E\\) in frame \\(o\\) is defined by \\(F_o = qE\\), where we fix our system of units by taking some arbitrary value for the charge \\(q\\) of the test particle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definition of electric charge: For charges other than the standard test charge, we take Gauss’s law to be our definition of electric charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charge is Lorentz invariant (section 1.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Fields must have transformation laws (section 10.2). Many times already in our study of relativity, we’ve followed the strategy of taking a Galilean vector and trying to redefine it as a four-dimensional vector in relativity. Let’s try to do this with the electric field. Then we would have no other obvious thing to try than to change its definition to \\(F = qE\\), where \\(F = ma\\) is the relativistic force vector (section 4.5), so that the electric field three-vector was just the spacelike part of \\(E\\). Because \\(a\\cdot v = 0\\) for a material particle, this would imply that \\(E\\) was orthogonal to o for any observer o. But this is impossible, since then a spacetime displacement vector s along the direction of \\(E\\) would be a vector of simultaneity for all observers, and we know that this isn’t possible in relativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The magnetic field\n",
      "\n",
      "Our situation is very similar to the one encountered in section 9.1, where we found that knowledge of the charge density in one frame was insufficient to tell us the charge density in other frames. There was missing information, which turned out to be the current density. The problems we’ve encountered in defining the transformation properties of the electric field suggest a similar “missing-information” situation, and it seems likely that the missing information is the magnetic field. How should we modify the assumptions above to allow for the existence of a magnetic field in addition to the electric one? What properties could this additional field have? How would we define or measure it?\n",
      "\n",
      "One way of imagining a new type of field would be if, in addition to charge \\(q\\), particles had some other characteristic, call it \\(r\\), and there was then be some entirely separate field defined by their action on a particle with this “r-ness.” But going down this road leads us to unrelated phenomena such as the the strong nuclear interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electromagnetic field tensor\n",
      "\n",
      "The nature of the contradiction arrived at in the above section is such that our additional field is closely linked to the electric one, and therefore we expect it to act on charge, not on \\(r\\)-ness. Without inventing something new like \\(r\\)-ness, the only other available property of the test particle is its state of motion, characterized by its velocity vector \\(v\\). Now the simplest rule we could imagine for determining the force on a test particle would be a linear one, which would look like matrix multiplication:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "But these are not \\(16\\) numbers that we can choose freely and independently. For example, consider a charged particle that is instantaneously at rest in a certain observer’s frame, with \\(v = (1, 0, 0, 0)\\). (In this situation, the four-force equals the force measured by the observer.) The work done by a force is positive if the force is in the same direction as the motion, negative if in the opposite direction, and zero if there is no motion. Therefore the power \\(P = dW/ dt\\) in this example should be zero. Power is the timelike component of the force vector, which forces us to take \\(\\mathcal {F}^{tt} = 0\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "More generally, consider the kinematical constraint \\(a\\cdot v = 0\\). When we require \\(a\\cdot v = 0\\) for any \\(v\\), not just this one, we end up with the constraint that \\(F\\) must be antisymmetric, meaning that when we transpose it, the result is another matrix that looks just like the original one, but with all the signs flipped:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\mathcal {F}^{tx} & \\mathcal {F}^{ty} & \\mathcal {F}^{tz}\\\\ -\\mathcal {F}^{tx} & 0 & \\mathcal {F}^{xy} & \\mathcal {F}^{xz}\\\\ -\\mathcal {F}^{ty} & -\\mathcal {F}^{xy} & 0 & \\mathcal {F}^{yz}\\\\ -\\mathcal {F}^{tz} & -\\mathcal {F}^{xz} & -\\mathcal {F}^{yz} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Each element equals minus the corresponding element across the main diagonal from it, and antisymmetry also requires that the main diagonal itself be zero. In terms of the concept of degrees of freedom introduced in section 3.5, we are down to \\(6\\) degrees of freedom rather than \\(16\\). We now relabel the elements of the matrix and follow up with a justification of the relabeling. The result is the following rank-\\(2\\) tensor:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\\mathcal {F}^{\\mu \\nu}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -E_x & -E_y & -E_z \\\\ E_x & 0 & -B_z & B_y \\\\ E_y & B_z & 0 & -B_x \\\\ E_z & -B_y & B_x & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll call this the electromagnetic field tensor. The labeling of the left column simply expresses the definition of the electric field, which is expressed in terms of the velocity \\(\\vec{v}=(1,0,0,0)\\) of a particle at rest. The top row then follows from antisymmetry. For an arbitrary velocity vector, writing out the matrix multiplication \\(\\mathcal {F}^{\\mu} = q\\mathcal {F}^{\\mu}\\: _{\\nu} \\: v^\\nu\\) results in expressions such as \\(F^x=\\gamma q(E_x+u_yB_z-u_zB_y)\\) (problem , p.~). Taking into account the difference of a factor of \\(\\gamma\\) between the four-force and the force measured by an observer, we end up with the familiar Lorentz force law,\n",

      "\n",
      "In Example 9.2.3, we saw that under the parity transformation \\((t, x, y, z) → (t, -x, -y, -z)\\), any rank-\\(2\\) tensor expressed in Minkowski coordinates changes the signs of its components according to the same rule:\n",

      "What about gravity?\n",
      "\n",
      "A funny puzzle pops up if we go back and think about the assumptions above that went into all this. Those assumptions were so general that it almost seems as though the only possible behavior for fields is the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. But other fields do behave differently. How did the assumptions fail in the case of gravity, for example? Gauss’s law (assumption 2) certainly holds for gravity. But the source of gravitational fields isn’t charge, it’s mass-energy, and mass-energy isn’t a Lorentz invariant, contrary to assumption 3. Furthermore, assumption 1 entailed that our field could be defined in terms of forces measured by an inertial observer, but for an inertial observer gravity doesn’t exist (section 5.2).\n",
